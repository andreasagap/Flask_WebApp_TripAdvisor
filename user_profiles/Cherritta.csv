The best of the bestest,"The restaurant looks very simple and in a shady area of downtown, but the seafood is fantastic and their home wine is delicious too. I prefer simple and fresh seafood (no overthinking), and this place exceeded my expectations. PS it's cheap too. And if they bring you bread and you don't want it, tell them right away, they will charge you for it",April 2019,Atlantikos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d7176555-Reviews-Atlantikos-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5

I wish it was a little bit more descriptive,"It's quite an interesting museum, but a lack of history description made the trip here a little bit boring.

pizza that is actually good for you,"We come to this place once or every 2 weeks, excellent choice for healthy eating, you don't feel 'heavy' or sick after you eat your whole pizza! I, personally, can't digest any other pizza in town..! I always have my food with a nice side of arugula salad and sometimes soup, Yamm!

"the best airport location, but no windows","The best location, no doubt. I am a bit claustrophobic, so this hotel is not a good option for me. There are no windows, and if you turn off the lights, it is a complete darkness. I will stay at this hotel only of I really have too. They should warn that there are no windows in the rooms.",June 2017,Glo Hotel Airport Vantaa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g226906-d235946-Reviews-Glo_Hotel_Airport_Vantaa-Vantaa_Uusimaa.html,"Vantaa, Finland",hotels,4.0,3.5

Pretty restaurant with ennoying music and slow service,"I like restaurants where you get warm welcome and great service, unfortunately, this is not a case for DOM. Their food was alright, but I didnt like the ambiance, i felt that music was too fast and too futuristic for this kind of restaurant. I won't be back.",December 2016,DOM restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g274958-d4471805-Reviews-DOM_restaurant-Tallinn_Harju_County.html,"Tallinn, Estonia",restaurants,3.0,4.0

Could be better,"Nice food and beer verity, cozy design, intersting music selection, excellent people watching spot but very slow service.. The restaurant was empty and bored servers were haning out by the entrance. My fish soup took a while unless they make every dish from scratch (cought fish from river etc.). All they have to do is to put smile on servers faces and provide good service.",December 2016,Ivan & Maria gastropub,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g298507-d8472037-Reviews-Ivan_Maria_gastropub-St_Petersburg_Northwestern_District.html,"St. Petersburg, Russia",restaurants,3.0,4.5
Good service but food was so so,"The service was excellent, food presentaton was good too. I didn't like how it tasted though, I think the fregile taste of seafood was spoiled by sauces and too much salt, not sure if i can recommend this place to anyone.",December 2016,Kopar Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189970-d4261105-Reviews-Kopar_Restaurant-Reykjavik_Capital_Region.html,"Reykjavik, Iceland",restaurants,3.0,4.5
The royal service,"If you are looking for the best service in St Peterburg and amazing food, this is the best place for that! Warm greeting, attention to detail, royal service and great food are main priorities of this restaurant. A must try is a Sahalin scallops dish, amazing! No other place can beat this one.

Very clean and nice rooms,"I've never stayed at Holiday Inn before, and this one at the airport is suprisingly nice! Conveniently located close to airport with 24 hour free buss service.

One of the worst ones,"The moment you step in you want to walk away. But we gave it a chance! The hostess made us to take off the jackets, we were not allowed to wear them ( we had summer jackets). After this unpleasant experience we still decided to have dinner there. There are 2 sections of the restaurant, they sat us at the very casual one, right under the aircon. We had to wait quite a while for a server. Finally, after a long wait, an irritated lady came over, she took our order, but it completely turned us away. I asked her to cancel our order, we took a cab to Four Seasons, to the best restaurants in town!",June 2016,Flying Dutchman,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g298507-d2349906-Reviews-Flying_Dutchman-St_Petersburg_Northwestern_District.html,"St. Petersburg, Russia",restaurants,1.0,4.0

Not to European standards,"This was my 3rd trip to this place. The first 2 times, I didn't buy anything. Everything just looked old, and not edible. After all this PM saying it's his favourite bake shop, I thought I just have to try it. So, I got some eclairs, some hazelnut pastries, and a fruit brioche (or something like that). Eclairs are my favourite European treats, and the ones from this bake shop were just exactly what you would expect from Canadian pastry: dry and stale, as if it was sitting there for quite a while, and that sweet butter inside...and in top...This was my first and the last visit.",May 2016,Duchess Bake Shop,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g154914-d2546034-Reviews-Duchess_Bake_Shop-Edmonton_Alberta.html,"Edmonton, Canada",restaurants,3.0,4.5
nice gateway!,"In the winter time, it is the best place to escape to. It feels like a nice vacation to a warm country. Very well taken care of, beautiful displays, it's worth a trip, for sure.

"If you like Greasy food, this place is for you","The food we ordered lacked any taste, the chicken sandwich I had didn't taste like anything, just grease all over it.

Excelence,"Your check in starts with the personal service, they already checked you profile and they know you need a late check out! Fine fabrics and attention to detail is all about Kamp hotel\s rooms! Try their Kamp burger, it is to die for. I don't normally eat french fries ( actually never), but the ones that are being served with Kamp burger are sooo goood!! The only miss was that the server didn't know why the hotel had a name ""Kamp""...",October 2015,Hotel Kamp,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189934-d199923-Reviews-Hotel_Kamp-Helsinki_Uusimaa.html,"Helsinki, Finland",hotels,5.0,4.5
Lobby bar,"We didn't stay at the hotel, we only had tea and coffee in the lobby bar 2 days in a row. The service was prompt and intuitive. The server even remembered the tea we had the day before, she was very welcoming and smiling! The lobby bar is an excellent place to relax and escape from the busy streets of the downtown area!

Poor service at the lobby bar,"We only had tea at this hotel after visiting Saint Isaac cathedral. The lobby bar was not busy, but the service was very slow. The server looked very sad, tired, and a bit irritated. There were 2 of us, but my boyfriend stepped away for a couple of minutes, so the server served only me. When my boyfriend came back, she completely ignored him. Then the server didn't even bring the bill, so we had to chase her..After she printed tons of different papers, we finally could get out from this place. This short experience was very dissapointing!",October 2015,Astoria Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g298507-d300108-Reviews-Astoria_Hotel-St_Petersburg_Northwestern_District.html,"St. Petersburg, Russia",hotels,2.0,4.5
Good for drinks but not for food,We tried some food off the menu and it was quite bad and disappointing!

Hotel's lounge,"Hotel and service are amazing but I would like to comment on their lounge in particular. In the summer time, their lounge has the best, sorry, the bestEST patio in town.

Got even better,"This is our second stay at Jardin de Frida, the first one was excellent and it just got better! Don't get me wrong, I've stayed at fancy Fairmont hotels, but this place is so unique and inviting! Unfortunately, restaurant was closed, so we didn't have a chance to try their food.

Beautiful and relaxing,"Such a nice escape from Edmonton! Easy drive, beautiful mountains, clean air! Lodge is beautiful and it feels like home there! It feels like a country side house. Don't expect anything fancy, it's wilderness there. I can imagine how expensive it is to run business there! Try bison burger, Tuna salad, carrot cake, and honey brown beer.

"'Beachhouse""'","House is beautiful and clean! There is no beach next to the beachhouse and it's far from everything(taxi, car, scooter, bike required). We couldn't do our laundry there either.
