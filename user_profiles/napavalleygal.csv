Okay lunch,"I knew Pacific Catch is known for fresh seafood and I selected Walnut Creek location as our mid-point for lunch. We both saw the garage across the street and parked under 3 hours for free. Observing covid-19 codes, tables were spaced apart, everyone was masked, and attentive. I was disenchanted with my fish 'n chips because the fish pieces were half the size compared with the photos. Generous helping with the fries though, flavorful coleslaw, and the fish was fresh and hot.

Wonderful lunch,"Via a review, open for dine-in now, we were welcomed and seated a table away from other diners, and were given extra napkins and iced water.
