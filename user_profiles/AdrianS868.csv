Not impressed,"Went with my wife for dinner to the Keytone Alley all excited for a nice dinner.
It had been several years that I had dinner there but remembered that the food was very impressive. Well this has changed dramatically.
We ordered some fish and chips because we both felt like it. As an appetizer we had six perogies.
The appetizer was a little disappointing but when we got the fish and chips it got a little worse. The fish was battered in a thick layer of greasy batter and was not appetizing at all. Even the little peace of fish in it was far below .
It will be a while before I return to this restaurant and certainly will not recommend it.

She was absolutely correct with this company. If you want to travel Sri Lanka this would be the only company whom I would contact and ultimately hire.

I contacted Sharon who immediately responded to my questions, needs and concerns. Immediate response, punctual and extremely helpful to put a travel itinerary together according the time you have and your interest.

When I arrived at the airport in Sri Lanka at 11.30PM, my contact, the guide and driver was there with a sign with my name on it.
My trip had started and I knew right away this trip would be worry free.

The driver his name was Sudara, an extremely polite you man very punctual and well spoken English. He instantly helped me to purchase a sim card for my phone and on the way we went.
His driving was very professional and defensive, safety first. For the next several days I was driven to different cities and sites. On time all the time, again polite and punctual. Helpful when needed at all times and every morning I stepped in a clean car.

Visit the Dordse Kerk and climb up the 364 steps to get a wonderful view of the city.

There is also het Maartens Gat where old storage places are now converted to apartments for the locals. The outside of these building are beautifully restored as well.

"Clean,friendly and good locations","I went to Yangon for leisure and to explore this city. Was not looking for anything fancy but nice enough not to be disappointed because there is nothing worse to have a dismal place to stay when you are on vacation or even for business.
After reading many reviews I decided to book the Bahosi Hotel in Yangon. It is located near the Bahosi Hospital in that city at a very convenient location. Within walking distance of down town but in a typical neighborhood of the city. I loved the location as it brings you right in-between the local people which is always my goal when I take such a trip.

About the hotel, it is super clean, the rooms are very basic but do have all the needs. The staff is helpful and friendly, a cornerstone is attached to the hotel, a restaurant or coffee shop is about a 5 to 10 minute walk. The neighborhood is quite at night for a good sleep. It is a wonderful place to stay for about 4 days to explore Yangon and do your own thing. When I explore a city I only sleep and have breakfast in a hotel and am not demanding in any sense. The only thing that was not my favorite was breakfast as it was rather a limited menu, no buffet. However there is toast, eggs, congee, noodles or fried rice but all very basic.
I would strongly recommend this hotel to any one who is adventurous and love to explore Yangon.

This place is extremely popular amongst locals so you might have to wait to be seated. The food you need to pick out ourself. What you need to do is take a server and ask him to help you. There is a huge selection to chose from, we choose about six dishes. There are numerous varieties of meats, vegetable, rice and noodles to choose from. The prices are cheap, people are honest and do not charge you any more because you are a foreigner.

Again not even close as this place was portrayed by the booking company!!! The breakfast was poor to say the least and I did not even want to try to have a dinner at this place.
Checking in takes about 30 to 45 minutes and checking out is even worse. Because of my work I stay in hotels 9 months out of a year and I am not kidding here. The Vits in Aurangabad is one of the poorest places I have stayed at over my past ten years of travelling.

An incredible piece of history,"In September I was working briefly in Aurangabad, India.
In the weekend I decided to take a private tour to the Ellora caves located about 30 KM north west of the city.
I left at about twelve noon as the caves were not too far away from the hotel that I was staying at. The drive, from the hotel to the caves was already very scenic through farmer fields, some hills and green spaces. The caves are located at the Charanandri hills. Ellora is a World Herritage Site.

When I arrived at the caves I viewed the smaller units first which were already and incredible experience. The site consist of 34 caves with the Kailasanatha Temple, which is cave number 16, the main attraction which my own opinion.
Considering that these caves were built between the 5th and the 10th century I see these units as an incredible piece of skill and art. Breath taking skills converted in these beautiful Temples Caves. Having also seen the runs of Ankor Wat this site came in a close second!!!

An afternoon well spend and I would encourage every history lover to visit this wonderful World Herritage Site. If you take your time and let the beautiful art of these carvings sink in it will take you about 5 to 6 hours to enjoy this fantastic and breath taking site.",September 2014,Ellora Caves,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297649-d317351-Reviews-Ellora_Caves-Aurangabad_Aurangabad_District_Maharashtra.html,"Aurangabad, India",attractions,5.0,4.5
A more than wonderful place to visit and having a dinner at the gardens is a must!,"This place is a wonderful botanical garden where you can walk around and relax. Tranquility would be the correct word to use.
Beautiful flowers, the lay out of this garden is absolutely breath taking. Visiting the store where you can purchase spices that are actually local grown.
Having a coffee or Thai dinner at the Monkey Tree restaurant is an absolute must. You will love the view of the Straight of Malakka . This is one of those unique places that are so hard to find!",September 2013,Tropical Spice Garden,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g660694-d968051-Reviews-Tropical_Spice_Garden-Penang_Island_Penang.html,"Penang Island, Malaysia",attractions,5.0,4.5
A dream world,"I planned a visit to Halong Bay after an extensive research. Never I will forget my overnight trip on a junk boat.
The scenery is more than breath taking. If you have the time go canoeing for a few hours, enjoy a visit to the local community who are living on their boats.
This place is a hidden gem and one of the most beautiful Unesco Herritage sites I have ever experienced.",November 2013,Halong Bay,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293923-d1968469-Reviews-Halong_Bay-Halong_Bay_Quang_Ninh_Province.html,"Halong Bay, Vietnam",attractions,5.0,4.5
Fantastic!!!!!!!!,"This Marriott Hotel in Chakan, Pune is located in the heart of Pune's industrial area where all the big automotive and motorcycle companies are located.
For business in this area I would recommend this hotel over anyone of the hotels downtown. Not only is the location extremely convenient but the house keeping, front desk and restaurant are outstanding. I have been staying at theirs place for the past six months and am signed up until December of 2014!!!!
I would like to call all the staff by their names but there are too many to mention!!! You are all fantastic and make me feel at home!!!! Thank you so much!!!!

Disappointed,"My night at the RamadaPowai was rather disappointing. I did not find the room very clean and also rather noisy.
There is mold in the shower stall which can cause respiratory problems. My sheets on my bed were stains as were my pillows. The towels were grey but suppose to be white. They were very old.
Unfortunately I will not stay at this property again.",June 2014,Ramada Powai Hotel & Convention Centre,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304554-d729456-Reviews-Ramada_Powai_Hotel_Convention_Centre-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,"Mumbai, India",hotels,2.0,4.0
Excellent stay!,"A wonderful home away from home!

I stayed at this hotel for six weeks during a business trip. Although the hotel is located in an industrial area,b where many companies set up shop,I would choose this Marriott over any other one in Pune Chakan.

This place is new but the staff is super friendly and helpful. House keeping is top notch.

The kitchen is very clean the food fresh and fantastic every day with wonderful varieties from India, China and Western countries.
The restaurant service staff is excellent and I need to compliment the following staff for their politeness, attendance and the manner they serve, Bablu, a manager, Pradip one foe the best waiters I have ever met with Rashid Ali. With thes three I need to compliment the remainder of the staff as well fantastic service guys!!!

Outstanding,"When I travel for pleasure I take an awful lot of time to book my hotels to ensure that I get clean accommodation in an area upon mu request.
I was planning a trip to Bali and wanted to stay our of the most commercial area so I ended up at the Bloo Lagoon Resort at Pandang Bai.

Thai resort is located at a top of a hill overlooking, I say the Java sea. I might not be correct but the view from our resort was nothing les than stunning.
This place has an extremely romantic setting. The house or space I had rented had a beautiful deck that included a dining area and sun chairs over looking the Java Sea.
The kitchen, toilet, shower and bath were all located, discretely outside in a garden like setting.
Daily housekeeping was excellent. Ale carte breakfast included.
The staff was incredible and there were no negatives for me to remark on. The place has full spa facilities. A beautiful beach with reefs is only a five minute walk down hill. Wonderful snorkelling and scuba diving.
The owner / manager of this place are wonderful people and they are around on daily basis. Approachable and ready to listen to suggestions or a friendly conversation.
Bali coffee is outstanding as is the kitchen staff. I should say all the staff.
This resort is a wonderful experience in a rather local setting.",August 2013,Bloo Lagoon Village,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1078452-d1389152-Reviews-Bloo_Lagoon_Village-Padangbai_Bali.html,"Padangbai, Indonesia",hotels,5.0,4.5
A wonderful hotel,"SoHo Metropolitan Hotel is a little tucked away in a rather nice area.
A wonderful note and fantastic staff. Check in was quick without any problems.
The room was super clean and hat off to the house keeping staff. It was a wonderful size and very nicely decorated.

Wonderful museum,"This museum has a wonderful appearance but also a fantastic lay-out.
It will take you through the history of the United States Air Force History which all started with the Wright Brothers.
The museum has several sections from the start of military aviation to todays aviation technology. It also has a cold war section, Air Force Hall of Fame, even some satellites and rockets are on display as is the capsule of the Apollo 15. Even an Imax theatre.

All air planes are original and retired from duty. Outside is a wonderful memorial park where you are able to enjoy a picnic lunch. Another beauty of this museum is that there is enough to do for children as well so a family adventure. There is a cafeteria, plenty of clean washrooms and storage lockers.

The entree of this museum is free of charge and all the staff are volunteers. The museum rely on your donations.
You will need a full day to enjoy this wonderful historic place.",July 2013,National Museum of the US Air Force,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60785-d603950-Reviews-National_Museum_of_the_US_Air_Force-Dayton_Ohio.html,"Dayton, Ohio",attractions,5.0,5.0
