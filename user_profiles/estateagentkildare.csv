Lovely food,Good solid food here and staff were very pleasant. We were tired after a long journey and the food here was most welcome. A very busy place. Really good scampi here and freshly cooked,May 2019,Paddy Foley's Restaurant & Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g211860-d1432181-Reviews-Paddy_Foley_s_Restaurant_Bar-Kenmare_County_Kerry.html,"Kenmare, Ireland",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Unpleasant stay,"We stayed here recently and unfortunatley we did not have a nice stay. The proprietor was pleasant on arrivel but after that he was not helpful and was quiet rude at times. The television did not work in the room and he did not come to sort it out when we asked. There were lots of signs on the back of the door about what not to do etc. The were similar signs in the livingroom. There were security cameras on the front door - most unusual in b and b's in Ireland. Breakfast is only served from 8 to 9.30 and again this is unusual in Ireland, especially at weekends. I totally agree with the reviewer who said they felt quite uncomfortable. The Breakfast was not great and there was only preserved fruit not fresh fruit. The eggs were fine, there was butter spread and not real butter. Honey was in a squeezie plastic carton. The room was fine but damp was obviosly a problem around the windows and the sheets were really thin.
They seem to want to just make money and in my opinion give b and b's a bad name",May 2019,Shaminir B&B,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g211860-d1069102-Reviews-Shaminir_B_B-Kenmare_County_Kerry.html,"Kenmare, Ireland",hotels,1.0,4.0

Great food and service. Views awesome,We just had dinner there. From the moment we arrived the service was very good. Darrel looked after us and he was really helpful. Food was all cooked individually and really fresh . We both had and it was really good. We had a table overlooking the sea and there was the most amazing sunset ever c such an added bonus.

Food not great and bad service,Food not great. Chips were lukewarm and I felt they were left over. The only veg was broccoli . Burger was ok. Service was indifferent and when we asked for the bill the waiter said he couldn't get as it wasn't his area. We then had.

Closely coffee oity about the paper cups and plates,"We had lovely coffee here. Cakes are great. It is such a pity that they use paper cups and plates and plastic knives. In a place as beautiful as Anchirage then I would think that people should not use these
paper and plastic items do we can keep our environment clean plus I think it's horrible to drink from paper cups",August 2016,Alaska Cake Studio,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60880-d1829865-Reviews-Alaska_Cake_Studio-Anchorage_Alaska.html,"Anchorage, Alaska",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Lovely food pity but pity about the loud televisions,I met a friend here fir a catch up. We had lovely bar food and the service was excellent. All was well until the TVs were turned up for some match. As thus was the only area and the mouse was loud we left. I don't understand why the whole bar was used for TVs coverage.

Georgous hotel in wonderful setting,"I recently stayed here and we had a really lovely time. The place is just comfortable and the staff were really friendly. The rooms are all built around a lovely courtyard and ours had a great view of the lake. Rooms were really spacious and beautifully decorated. Staff were really nice and chatty and this place felt more like a country house rather than the formality of a hotel. I would highly recommend here as it is set in a lovely woodland with great walks all around the lake. Cong is a beautiful little village and this whole area is great for sightseeing places like Ballintubber Abbey, Galway and the beautiful West of Ireland.",July 2016,The Lodge At Ashford Castle,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g663560-d2203542-Reviews-The_Lodge_At_Ashford_Castle-Cong_County_Mayo_Western_Ireland.html,"Cong, Ireland",hotels,5.0,4.5
Pleasant conference hotel but breakfast is like school.,This place has a few buildings so you may get wet if it's raining. No lifts so I had to haul luggage to 2nd floor. Room was spotless but rooms are small. All facilities like iron hairdryer etc. Breakfast is not good as you can only get tea from a flask and its lukewarm. You feel it's like a school canteen. Fruit is limited and selection is not hood. It lacks the finer touch. There did not appear to be anybody in charge. There is a nice pub The Craddock around the corner and its good for dinner,June 2016,College Court Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186334-d4876888-Reviews-College_Court_Hotel-Leicester_Leicestershire_England.html,"Leicester, United Kingdom",hotels,3.0,4.0
