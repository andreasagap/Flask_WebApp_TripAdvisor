Great Guided Tour,"We took the Beyond the Bars tour and I am so glad we did this instead of only the self guided tour. You can still do the self-guided tour after you have finished the guided tour but most of the self guided tour is not worth it, but more about that in a bit.

Our guides (who have been driving 4 hours, one-way, to do this for years) were great. On the Beyond the Bars tour you get to go into areas where the self-guided tour does not allow you to go: the attic where the original hospital was, the sub-basement, and other areas. If it's a nice day (it's outside) you also get to go up to one of the turrets where one of the guard towers is located.

Our guides were well informed and stopped often to allow you to look around, ask questions, or give you a breather. There are a lot of stairs on this tour but it wasn't as bad as I expected.

Keep in mind regardless of what tour you take that unless you absolutely love the heat I wouldn't go on a hot day because it can get quite warm. Also I would recommend wearing comfortable shoes that are closed (like sneakers) because there's a lot of dust and dirt.

Now to the self guided tour. Personally the only parts of this that were good were the museum areas. One area has different rooms that have artifacts from the reformatory and literature to go along with them. The other museum area has information and artifacts from The Shawshank Redemption. Beyond these 2 areas most everything else on the self-guided tour you see on the guided tour. There are a lot of rooms on the self-guided tour that you don't see on the guided tour but they all look pretty similar to one another & I didn't really feel I got much out of seeing these rooms.

The guided tour took almost 2 hours.",August 2019,Ohio State Reformatory,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g50599-d260123-Reviews-Ohio_State_Reformatory-Mansfield_Ohio.html,"Mansfield, Ohio",attractions,5.0,4.5
Worst Airline Ever,"I have been flying for over 50 years & this is the worst airline I have ever flown on. The seats were hard and very uncomfortable. This was the first airline I have flown on that didn't have an air vent, and the first fight was extremely warm. The food food, particularly on the flight out of the country, was horrible - worse airline food ever. The movies were censored too which I have never experienced.",April 2019,Turkish Airlines,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8729174-Reviews-Turkish-Airlines,World,flights,1.0,4.0
A Must See,"For anyone traveling to Athens this is a must see site. I recommend going in the afternoon when it's a little less crowded, going on a non-rainy day & if possible on a weekday. Also if you are going to various sites in Athens purchase the multi-site pass for 30 Euros, or a skip the line ticked for the Acropolis. Lastly, I had read many reviews and information about various sites before going to Athens & the one thing they all said is that the 7 sites which are included in the multisite pass can be seen in one day. I very much disagree with this because just the Acropolis and north and south slopes of the Acropolis (all included in the ticket for the Acropolis) can take many hours.

When you take the walk up to the Acropolis there's a hill you can walk up onto which overlooks the city. There are stairs or rocks to get up this hill. Visitors beware because the rocks (even on top) are extremely slippery. Once you have taken in this view you are ready to go up to the Acropolis.

The walk up the Acropolis can also be slippery which is why I said go on a non-rainy day. There are many things to see on the way up including Herod Atticus Odeon theatre. Once you have made it to the top and go through the The Propylaia there is the Parthenon and other ancient buildings.

There is also the south and north slope of the Acropolis which shouldn't be missed. There are Stoas, Theatre of Dionysos and other sites as well.",April 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Great Olive Oil Tasting/Seminar,"We had initially wanted to take a tour of an olive grove while in Greece, but for various reason were unable to do so. Instead we opted for the olive oil tasting/seminar at Yoleni's and I am so glad we did this. I have been to Italy & Spain and brought back olive oil from each country, but I was really wanting to taste and purchase olive oil from the best makers of olive oil in the world: the Greeks.

I say this is a tasting/seminar because we not only got to taste several different olive oils but we were taught about olive oil: the history, the taste of different olive oils, the benefits, etc.

The was a really great experience for anyone who loves food and/or olive oil or even if you just want to learn about olive oil while getting to taste it. The host, Yannis, made this experience even better. He was charming, funny, informative & helpful. I would actually do this experience again especially if Yannis was the host.",April 2019,Yoleni's Greek Gastronomy Center,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d11851409-Reviews-Yoleni_s_Greek_Gastronomy_Center-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Don't Understand What People are Raving About,"On a recent trip to Athens we found that Mani Mani not only had great reviews but it had also been featured in a NY Times video from a few years ago titled 36 Hours in Athens. We were really looking forward to this meal, but sadly we were very disappointed.

We started off sharing the Greek salad first & it was the one dish we both really liked. The salad part tasted fresh & vibrant. The pasta part was unique & flavorful. Next we had the ravioli. The pasta tasted handmade & was cooked perfectly. However, it was completely ruined by the overly salty sauce.

For my entree I had the lamb. I really enjoy lamb and was looking for to having a nice lamb dish with in Athens. Sadly this was the worst lamb dish I have ever had. It was a small piece of lamb loin (not too small) that still had the fat cap on. I have no objection to the fat cap as fat adds flavor. This fat cap was not properly rendered though and the lamb, while extremely tender, was the most flavorless piece of meat I have ever had. The only good part of this dish was the beluga lentils.

My companion had Hilopites (pasta with chicken, basil pesto, peas, sundried tomatoes & cheese). The pasta was cooked properly but the dish was dry and flavorless (not as flavorless as the lamb though).

At the end of the meal were were brought Mastika which was the first time we had had this Greek liquor. It was fabulous! When we were finished we had to wait 20 minutes to receive our check. The restaurant was mostly empty at this point so we didn't understand why we had to wait so long.",April 2019,Mani Mani,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d695929-Reviews-Mani_Mani-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,2.0,4.5
Expected Better,"This is one of the top 8 restaurants on Restaurant Row according to Zagat. They are supposed to have really good burgers, so this is what I ordered. Sadly they couldn't cook my burger to the correct temperature. Normally I would have sent it back but I was so hungry I ate it anyway. If it was horrible I definitely would have sent it back but it's so disappointing that a place known for burgers was unable to cook mine correctly. The accompanying fries were good. I did tell the waitress about the overcooked burger & she did offer to have my order redone. Since I had decided to eat the burger anyway I was offered a free dessert. You may think this isn't a fair trade-off but the desserts were almost as expensive as the burger. My waitress was really good.",May 2018,Joe Allen,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d478775-Reviews-Joe_Allen-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Yum!,Stopped in here for a coffee and a sweet treat and was not disappointed. I ordered a chocolate cupcake and a snickerdoodle cookie. The cupcake was moist and the frosting not too sweet. The snickerdoodle cookie may have been the best one I ever had. I went back the next day for a bagel -- nothing like a New York bagel -- and it did not disappoint. I also got a chocolate sourdough twist which was delicious! They have a variety of breads and other sweets - wish I could have tried more of their breads or bought some to bring back home.,May 2018,Amy's Bread,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d887308-Reviews-Amy_s_Bread-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Wish I had stayed some place else,"My room, and I imagine most or all of the rooms, have window air conditioners. Mine was very loud. When I first arrived it was a very warm day and the cool felt good. By evening the temperature outside had dropped significantly but the room was still warm so I still had the air conditioning on. In the morning the air conditioning was spewing water all over the ledge and the bed and no cool air was coming out. I turned it off and waited a bit before turning it back on and it started working properly. However, by the following morning it was spewing even more water than it had before. Between the noise and the lack of proper cooling it was difficult to get a good night's sleep.

The room could be cleaner. It definitely needs updated as there are cracks in the walls and ceiling. At least one electrical outlet was cracked.

I kept the Do Not Disturb card on the outside door for my entire stay and this is what I do every time I stay in a hotel. Despite this someone came into my room on 2 separate occasions while I was out. I know this because I had turned all the lights off and returned to find a light on each time.

I assume they use satellite for the TV and Internet service because it is not reliable.

Most disappointing is that if I had made this reservation 2 weeks earlier I would have paid a lot less and even that price was way too much for this hotel.

The only good thing I can say about it is that it's in a great location and one of the receptionist (Jasmine) was very nice.",May 2018,Econo Lodge Times Square,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60763-d93359-Reviews-Econo_Lodge_Times_Square-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",hotels,2.0,4.0
Eh,"This is one of the worst pizza places I have ever been to. They claim to be different and have unusual pizza which is not exactly true; There are some different pizzas on their menu but most are not. I would have loved to order a veggie pizza but their version is boring (cheese, mushrooms, black olives, onions, green peppers, tomatoes). Instead since I was with a meat lover we agreed on the Bronx Bomber (cheese, pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, onions, green peppers, black olives). It was fair and the sausage was some prefab sausage that was either sliced in house or came bagged that way. The main reason I chose this pizza was because of the sausage and it was the worst Italian sausage I have ever had.

I also had a House salad (field greens, toasted pine nuts, sun-dried cranberries, Goat cheese with house-made balsamic dressing) which was good although it had too much dressing for my taste.

The only thing worse than the pizza was one of the servers. The place was mostly empty and when a server asked if we were ready to order I wanted to know if the sausage on the pizza was Italian. Instead of answering my question she responded by saying it's not spicy. I responded by telling her I didn't care if it was spicy, that I wanted to know if it is Italian sausage. She didn't know, so I asked if she would check. She gave me a dirty look and said she would go check which she never did. A few minutes later a different person came over to the table to see if we were ready to order and this person was pleasant and able to answer my question right away. (It should state it's Italian sausage on the menu.)

I understand Dewey's is trying to make gourmet/unusual pizza but they are far from it. If you want to have good gourmet pizza do no go to Dewey's. Instead go to Zpizza.",September 2016,Dewey's Pizza,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g51177-d6533104-Reviews-Dewey_s_Pizza-Worthington_Ohio.html,"Worthington, Ohio",restaurants,2.0,4.5
Average to Poor,"This hotel is in a great location which is the best thing I can say about it. I really liked that it was not on one of the extremely busy tourist streets, but still close enough to everything to walk. It's very close to an Aerobus stop which we took from the airport for 5,50 Euros. This same stop is also where there is a Metro station.

The room was booked for 2 people and it really wasn't large enough for 2 people. It had 2 single beds that were pushed together and there was not enough room to separate them. This was okay for me and my travel companion but I am sure it would not be for many people. The room was clean.

The worst thing about the room was it was very hot. No matter how we adjusted the air it did not make a difference. Thankfully we had a sliding glass door that opened to a balcony which we had to leave open every evening in order for it to be a comfortable temperature for sleeping. If it wasn't for this I would have requested a different room.

The other thing people should be aware of is the check-in time: 2pm. While all hotels have a check-in time I have never had to actually wait if I arrived early. I had read that other people had to wait until 2pm and we did too. It all worked out but after traveling for so long and with the time change I would have preferred to be able to get into my room right away.

There's free WiFi which worked well.",March 2016,Caledonian Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187497-d228556-Reviews-Caledonian_Hotel-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,"Barcelona, Spain",hotels,3.0,4.0
Perhaps the highlight of our trip,"This is one of the most stunning buildings I have ever seen. The color coming inside through the stained glass windows is wonderful. I cannot even begin to express the gorgeous architecture of Sagrada Familia.

We also went up into one of the towers (there's an extra fee for this), but I highly suggest it. At the time we went there were 2 towers you could go up and we went up the Nativity facade which looks out over Barcelona.

We spent 3 hours there and I took over 100 photographs.

I recommend going early because it's less crowded. I also suggest getting your tickets ahead of time.",March 2016,Basilica of the Sagrada Familia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187497-d190166-Reviews-Basilica_of_the_Sagrada_Familia-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,"Barcelona, Spain",attractions,5.0,4.5

Easy,"We took the Aerobus from the airport to our hotel. It was easy to locate and inexpensive (5,50 Euros). It had a stop just a few minutes walk from our hotel.

The Genius of Gaudi,"The only Gaudi attraction we saw that was more amazing then Casa Mila (the original name for La Pedrera) was Sagrada Familia.

There are 2 options when touring Casa Mila: La Pedrera by Day or The Origins (a night tour). We did both and I definitely suggest both. During the day you can stroll and your leisure and really look at everything (the best parts being The Attic and the rooftop). The evening tour is an actual tour which we were happily surprised by. You get to find out a lot of interesting things about Casa Mila this way and it ends with a light show on the roof.",March 2016,Casa Milà - La Pedrera,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187497-d190629-Reviews-Casa_Mila_La_Pedrera-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,"Barcelona, Spain",attractions,5.0,4.5
Interesting,"This museum has a lot of Picasso's early work which I had never seen before. It shows the progression of his work up to a certain point which I enjoyed viewing and reading about.

Fabulous!,"I have had the opportunity to eat at many good restaurants around the world and this one is in my top 5. If you have not made a reservation to have a table (reservation are a must for a table) then get there early and wait in line for them to open for seating at the counter. We arrived 15 minutes before opening on what I believe would be a slower evening, so I imagine of the weekend you would have to arrive even earlier.

The waiter will recommend the general tapas which consisted of 4-5 different dishes. This is what we did except for our final plate. The waiter informed us that we had one more dish and could choose from seafood or meat. Instead each of us wanted something specific for the final plate. I chose prawns which were out of this world delicious! We even had dessert -- I don't know what it was called but it was something with custard and it was one of the best desserts I have ever had.",March 2016,Cal Pep,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187497-d697458-Reviews-Cal_Pep-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,"Barcelona, Spain",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Great Place,"We went here for the paella. They offer 3 different choices of paella: seafood, meat or combination. All of them are 10 euros per person, 2 people minimum. We ordered the meat paella and it was great! Some of the meat is still on the bone so you need to be careful. The place is very busy so if you go later you may have to wait for a table. The service was also one of the best we received in Barcelona.

Great Seafood,If you are in this part of Italy you should definitely try some fresh seafood. I highly recommend La Bettola del Gusto. The octopus appetizer was the best I have ever had. Everything we had was very fresh. For an entree I had the grilled seafood plate which had several different types of seafood on it. The best part of this was the local catch. My companion had pasta that had clams and muscles and it was a lot better than my entree. The services was very good and paced just right.,October 2013,La Bettola del Gusto,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187786-d1989612-Reviews-La_Bettola_del_Gusto-Pompeii_Province_of_Naples_Campania.html,"Pompeii, Italy",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Beautiful Scenery,This is a very quaint little town (you can walk from one end to the other in 5 minutes). If you go here you must go up on the wall (2 Euros) because the view of the countryside is magnificent! You also get a different perspective of the town from atop of the wall. It's my understanding that there's a Medieval festival that takes place here in the summer which would definitely go back during this time to see. There's shops and food if you are so inclined.,October 2013,Walls of Monteriggioni,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g227886-d2539725-Reviews-Walls_of_Monteriggioni-Monteriggioni_Tuscany.html,"Monteriggioni, Italy",attractions,5.0,4.5
Good Pasta and Steak,"We went to Le Fonticine after an exhausting day because it was across the our hotel. I ordered risotto for an appetizer and it was not very good. For my entree I had the tripe which was very good. However, the service was horrible. By the time we were finished with our entree, we couldn't even get the attention of our waiter. We probably would have ordered dessert if he had bothered to check on us. I had to get the attention of someone else to to get our check. Then another waiter came over who I later found out was also the manager. He asked if there was a problem and I proceeded to tell him that the risotto was flavorless and explained the bad service. He made an adjustment to our check and also offered me a free cocktail one of which was Grappa that I had. He did say they were known for their fresh pasta and steak. This manager, ""Super Mario,"" apologized profusely and he was also very charming. On our way out we also talked with the owner. We did decide to give Le Fonticine a second try on our last night in Firenze.

This second go around was great. We were seated in Super Mario's section, and still trying to make up for the debacle from our first visit he gave a a glass of Prosecco on the house. We shared a pasta appetizer which was very good. We both had the Tagliata di Manzo servita al Rosmarino e scaglie di Parmigiano (grilled steak with rosemary and Parmisan cheese) which was cooked to perfection and was one of the most tender steaks I have ever had. And this time we did have dessert. Mario brought me over to their dessert case and I chose a dessert for myself (a poached pear which was excellent) and mascarpone for my companion (also excellent). I also had a glass a Grappa which if I had not been given it the first time we were here I would not have have it again -- it was the best Grappa I have ever tasted.

Oh, and the couple who was sitting next to us were from England. It was the woman's birthday and her present was a surprise trip to Firenze. She had been to Le Fonticine before and chose to go here again for her birthday. So I do recommend this restaurant but don't try the risotto. Stick with what they do best -- steak and pasta -- and if you have the opportunity to seat in Mario's section do so. He is one of the best waiter's I have ever come across.",October 2013,Ristorante Le Fonticine,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187895-d1034477-Reviews-Ristorante_Le_Fonticine-Florence_Tuscany.html,"Florence, Italy",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Worst Hotel Ever,"I wish I could give this place a negative star rating. Just entering this place is horrible. It's a huge step up to open the door -- not an actual step but the doorway is raised at least a foot.

As soon as I entered the room I was unhappy since I could not immediately find the light switch. It was behind the door instead of right inside the doorway. Not having the light in a convenient location made me feel unsafe.

The bathtub had some sort of dark pink covering over it in areas that was peeling off. I'm not sure if it was supposed to look like that or not but it made me think I shouldn't use it. The bathroom light was not inside the bathroom nor was it right outside the bathroom. Instead it was around the corner. There also wasn't an option not to have the fan running.

The worst part was the room was it had the most horrible order ever that I think was coming from the carpet. The carpet was absolutely filthy and I kept my shoes on while walking on it.

I was exhausted after traveling for 10+ hours and this was only going to be a quick stop before catching another flight in the morning. Otherwise I would have left as soon as I saw the room.",October 2013,Econo Lodge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g41654-d89761-Reviews-Econo_Lodge-Malden_Massachusetts.html,"Malden, Massachusetts",hotels,1.0,2.0
Good Location,"This hotel is in a good location in Firenze. There's vendors right around the corner and plenty of places to dine within a short walking distance. The train station is very close too. Firenze is really a walking city and the Accademia, the Uffizi and the Ponte Vecchio are all within walking distance.

The room was clean. One odd feature was that you need to place the key card in a slot when you enter the room. This enables all the electricity to work. It is a good idea to save on utilities but I was not a fan of this feature.

There was something wrong with both of the beds in that the mattresses leaned -- like they were completely worn out on one side and each bed was worn out on the opposite side.

For a small feel you can purchase tickets in advance for the Accademia and the Uffizi from the front desk which enables you to avoid standing in line. You actually receive a voucher and you exchange it for tickets. If you are traveling with anyone who can't stand for long, etc. it's worth the extra charge.
