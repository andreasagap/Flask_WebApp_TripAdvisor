Excellent gateaway,"A few kilometers away from the main city, this is an excellent gateaway resort with a good view and beach. The villas are well maintained and spacious. The kitchen has fridge, oven, stove so that you can cook too. We did not order the main course but ordered dessert which was good. Just a short walk and you can reach the private beach (dont miss the swing in the middle of water). On the whole highly recommend for a short trip especially in this restricted travel time.",May 2021,Jaw Resort and Spa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293997-d21338921-Reviews-Jaw_Resort_and_Spa-Manama.html,"Manama, Bahrain",hotels,5.0,5.0

Just a view,This place is near the Acropolis/Acropolis Museum. You can view it from outside as the entrance ticket of EUR 6/- is not worth it.

A great place to visit,"We visited this place as a day tour from Athens. It is a full day tour. But the place is worth the visit. On the way the guide explained to us the history of the place. Note that it is a good walk and you should wear comfortable clothes and shoes and also take water with you. Visit the place where the 1st Olympic games was held. That's way at the top.
On the whole, worth the trip.",October 2019,Delphi,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189408-d523823-Reviews-Delphi-Delphi_Phocis_Region_Central_Greece.html,"Delphi, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0

A sure visit site in Athens,A site which is rich in heritage of Greece and a must visit place. Take 2 to 3 hours to leisurely visit the place.

Good stay,"The hotel is centrally located. Walk able distance to Monastiraki Square and also to Placa. Close to lots of restaurants and eat outs too. Rooms are okay and the staff is also courteous. Quite a night life at Monastiraki square.
Ensure to have your reservations properly checked out before you arrive. We included our b/f but were forced to pay as the hotel received the booking w/o b/f. (Even though we claimed the amount back from the travel agent, we surely lost in forex conversion).",October 2019,Attalos Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d235705-Reviews-Attalos_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.0
Great place to stay with an awesome view,"This hotel is a great place with a splendid views. I visited with a group of friends and this was just the right place. Staff was very courteous and very helpful. Special mention to Thanos and Anastasia for being very helpful.
The place is also walk-able distance from some good restaurants. Also, the bus stops right outside the hotel - so the commute is easy. However, the wifi was not working very well. We were told it is the service provider's problem.

Average hotel,"A very average hotel I would say. Don't go by the photos. The room is so full of the bed set that there was hardly any place to stand and also the toilet was broken. We had to change our room to an AC room, but guess what we had flies in the room inspite of that. Food was average too.
One big advantage is it is situated close to both Gloucester Road and Earl’s Court Underground Station which are on either side. Some good food joints around too.

Amazing trip of 10 lakes,"We took the Full day tour of the 10 lakes from Lake District. We had a delayed start as some traveler decided to come in late. So, please be considerate and arrive on time. If you are coming by car ensure you arrive a little early to park the car as the car park is a little away from the pick up point.
But luckily we had a clear day and hence were able to move fast and had clear scenic sites and beautiful views.
The drive is in a 16-seater van. Try to sit on the left side (that is single seat side) to get better views.
The driver was very knowledgeable and so had lots of info to share.

Wasnt a good experience,"We booked the 12 hours trip to Bruges from Amsterdam through a travel agent who used BUENDIA TOURS. The tour takes about 3 hours to reach Bruges. In the bus, we had a guide who spoke so much in Spanish which we could not follow. He did not even ask if all understood Spanish. Then when we asked him he just said 2 lines to explain what all he spoke for nearly 15 min in Spanish. Next when we reached Bruges, there another English guide joined us along with other travelers now this was a sizeable crowd of english speaking people. But the guide was so bad in English that we could hardly follow what he was talking. After some rambling he left us at a central place. The moment he said bye, no one stopped or even looked back (everyone was so disappointed that we got nothing for this trip). And then after sometime we gather to go back for the 3 hour trip back.
We got to know nothing about the place or its value because someone decided to use a guide who was just rambling.
I am sure the place is good but with less knowledge of what is what it was not interesting at all.",July 2019,Bruges bus tour from Amsterdam,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g188590-d15777887-Bruges_bus_tour_from_Amsterdam-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",activities,2.0,4.5

Since we arrived early we went directly to the Exhibition where they exchanged tickets for us. Royal mews you can enter till 4.30 pm while the time slot for the Palace itself is timed so ensure you are there on time.
The exhibition took about an hour and Royal mews (admire the royal chariots and no horses) for about 45 min then move to the palace.

Right from the start the show brings out laughter and then even more laughter. The best scenes are when the lead woman acts out and the guy tries to decipher what she is saying.

Will take around 1.5 hours to cover the first 3 floors if you take time to see. . Vortex is on 2nd floor and isnt too long a tunnel so can be easily managed.
The highlight is the camera obscura on the 5th floor. Dont miss this 10 min show. You will be surprised.

Please avoid,I am surprised that this restaurant is named Gandhi. The first time we went there weren't many people so it was fine. But when we went back a second time during rush hour they said that the order was too small and we need to order everything at one go. And so we could go as they needed the table. This is the first time ever we have met with this kind of behaviour from a hospitality industry. No not once in the 30 odd countries we have visited. Avoid it.

The thought behind the museum is well depicted in all its glory. How Belfast's industry was growing, how people worked on the ship, the drawings, where she was etc..you can sense all this at the museum. A good gift shop and 2 good cafes complete the experience.

An experience it is...,"World's largest ice cave and who wouldn't want to visit it...it is an experience in many ways.
1. The travel to the ticket center is itself through some slopes-car/bus.
2. From the ticket center to the cable car ..navigate through some very steep slopes to get to the cable car. 20 to 30 min walk.
3. Take the cable car...less than 5 min.
4. From the cable car to the caves...again steep slopes and one lon....g walk..
5. Reach the caves and wait for the guided tour(compulsory).
6. Here you will need your warm clothes, gloves for sure and something g to cover you head and ears...its pretty cold inside.
7. Climb up and down nearly 1400 steps..the first 400 steps are at a stretch and is a challenge.
8. Wear clothes in layers as you may feel very hot as you keep climbing.
9. No photos allowed. Every 4th or 5th person is give an oil lamp to carry. The guide we had was very good.
10. Saw many small kids on the trip.
11. Take lots of water and snacks too. There are restuarants at the ticket center, cable car center though.
Experience it is...long hiking....long walk...hot weather outside but very cold inside the caves...",August 2018,Eisriesenwelt,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1165061-d590707-Reviews-Eisriesenwelt-Werfen_Austrian_Alps.html,"Werfen, Austria",attractions,4.0,4.5

A great place to visit,A nice place to visit. The best part of the palace is not only the interiors but the fountains. Take the guided tour and get soaked...see the fountains which all run on simple mechanics but are so nice to see as these date back to the 18th century. Also get to see the sound of music pavilion -you are 16 going on 17 song filmed pavilion just near the garden entrance. You can have a picnic too in the gardens.

Excellent trip,"An experience not to be missed. All guided tours. You are given some white clothes to wear inside the mines. First take a train.
Which looks more like a toy train..but it is fun. Then go through the mines a little walk with guide and movie stories. Then slide down a wooden plank..hey it's fun too...( or there are stairs right next). Great fun..",August 2018,Salt Mine Hallein,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g641734-d1808421-Reviews-Salt_Mine_Hallein-Hallein_Austrian_Alps.html,"Hallein, Austria",attractions,5.0,4.5
