Hats off to Chef Steve Young!,"We dined here for my birthday on Friday and both got the 6 course chef's tasting menu with wine pairing. I had my heart set on the beef wellington which was not on the tasting menu, but the chef was more than happy to accommodate that among our meal, so we got it. All 6 courses were absolutely delicious and the chef came out to introduce himself when he brought out our main course and dessert, we thought that was a special treat. I highly recommend this place as the service and meal is 5 star and there are a lot of great options on the menu to choose from. You will not be disappointed here.",August 2019,Edge Steakhouse,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g45963-d7952009-Reviews-Edge_Steakhouse-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html,"Las Vegas, Nevada",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Excellent Brunch,"We stopped by here with a 2 for 1 brunch certificate on our last day in Vegas. This little restaurant is beautiful on the inside. The service is outstanding. Our waiter did not let us go without filling up the bottomless beverage for even a minute. We both got the tasters choice which included the pancakes, french toast, omelette, and Braised Beef Benedict. The Benedict is like we have never had before, definitely our favorite. The omelette was nice as it had asparagus in it, which we both love. The french toast was fantastic, had a strong banana flavor and was cooked to perfection. We both thought the pancakes were a bit dry and bland, but there was plenty of food there that made up for that. The prices are a bit steep for what you get, so we were very glad to have a 2 for 1 discount.",August 2019,Fleur,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g45963-d556773-Reviews-Fleur-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html,"Las Vegas, Nevada",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Better than we had expected!,"We knew this was a budget airline, and after reading reviews were a little scared of what we would find. Everything went way smoother than we expected. The check in was quick and they quickly checked our bags, assigned us seats and sent us to the plane each time. The flights were on time, efficient loading, seats were the same as all other airlines, tight and upright with little legroom. But, they served us free drinks and snacks on the airplane which we didn't expect due to other reviews; however, I believe it was free due to it being an international flight rather than domestic. There is no in flight entertainment, WiFi, or power ports.

Our luggage came to us both directions unharmed and we got there safe. What more do you need in a flight? I would definitely use them again if going to Mexico.",May 2019,Viva Aerobus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d10533096-Reviews-Viva-Aerobus,World,flights,4.0,3.0
Good for what you pay for...,"We went to this resort as a last minute getaway and found many pros and a few cons to the place. Let me start with the pros.

The grounds are absolutely stunning. Walking around (and there will be a lot of it, as it is a big resort) is a joy! They definitely spend endless amounts of time on the landscaping and the paths through the jungle are spectacular. Even though it is a big place with lots of people, you never feel crowded. The rooms (we were in building 15 about midway, but closer to the lobby than beach) was more than enough comfort. The bed was a very nice firm mattress, the air conditioner keeps it at just the perfect temperature, the shower has plenty of water pressure, and there is sufficient room for your clothes and supplies. The fridge was filled up every day with everything that we needed, from water, beer, and soda, and we had cute little towel animals on our bed every day. The house keepers do a fantastic job.

The pool is definitely one of the best swimming pools I have ever been to at a resort with endless twists and turns rising up to 4'7"" in several parts of the pool making it a nice swimming pool. It is salt water so it does not bleach out your suits or leaving you smelling like chlorine at the end of the day. It was cleaned daily and kept up nice. There are so many bali beds, and shaded lounge chairs around the pool that you will always find a place to lounge and stay shaded throughout the day. It was never too crowded to where you could not find a spot.

There were bars all over the resort, swim up bars at the pool, bars at the lobby, and bars at the beach. Just don't go too far down the south side of the beach to the sister properties and expect a drink, they will not serve you (even though it is the same drinks on the other side of the beach where we are staying).

Now, on to the items that I would like to see improvement on. The chairs and table on the balconies (and the balconies are beautiful and private), are cheap plastic and uncomfortable, so you don't want to spend much time on them. We did have one day where we left our bali bed by the pool for an hour to get a massage and they took our belongings and towels and moved them out for another group to use, so when we came back our stuff was gone and people who did not speak English was in our bed. We were not sure where to find our things or how to get our towels back to go find another spot.

Now, for the food.....we ate at the Brazilian, French, Italian, Steakhouse, Mediterranean, and Buffet. We have a very hard time recommending the food or any of the restaurants as we were not impressed with any of them. We are used to going to higher caliber resorts, so our standards on food is high. We didn't find that we couldn't eat anything, as we found plenty of food that was OK, but nothing made us smile and want to go back. The mangoes on the buffet were in season and absolutely delightful though. We did get roped into going to the breakfast presentation one morning and got the pleasure of eating breakfast at the Grand. That buffet was definitely way improved from what our resort was serving each morning. Even down to the drinks and coffee were a step above our resort. Now, the biggest improvement they could make is to upgrade the house wine. I love wine with my dinner and tried on 2 occasions to drink the house wine with dinner and regretted it every time. It is absolutely unfit to drink. Seriously, there are a lot of inexpensive tasty wines out there you could serve as your house wine. If you could ever take any of my advice, please change the white and red wine you serve. It is the worst I have ever had.

The beach was full of seaweed, unfortunately it made it tough to encounter the smell out there, so we walked the beach once a day, but spent no time out there due to the smell. Not the resorts fault, but tough to deal with if you are beach dwellers like we are, hence why we spent all our days at the pool. We were glad the pool was so stellar. But, minus the seaweed, there were plenty of palapas and chairs available each day, and the crew tried their best to clean it up daily, it was just too much to handle. We were told it has been really bad along the whole area for the last year.

The shows at night were a bit cheesy and tough to watch. We tried watching them on three different nights and did not get through any of them without getting up and going back to the room early. And, outside the shows there were only a one many show singing in the lobby at night, mostly in Spanish.

I think we would have been happier staying at one of the upgraded sister properties, and wish they would have offered us an upgrade when we checked in, but they offered us only what we paid for in advance and so we took it as it was an inexpensive trip. All in all, for what we paid we were happy with what we got. It is a good resort to stay at for the price.",May 2019,Iberostar Paraiso Del Mar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g663501-d315136-Reviews-Iberostar_Paraiso_Del_Mar-Playa_Paraiso_Playa_del_Carmen_Yucatan_Peninsula.html,"Playa Paraiso, Mexico",hotels,4.0,4.5
Excellent place to go for good food at good prices!,"I was only in Vegas for 2 days on this trip, but ate at Grand Lux Cafe twice because the food is delicious, the portions are mighty, the martinis are good, and the prices are very reasonable. I will hit this place every time I visit Vegas because the menu is so vast that I could eat there everyday for a month and still not eat something twice. They had the best key lime pie I have ever had!",March 2019,Grand Lux Cafe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g45963-d481406-Reviews-Grand_Lux_Cafe-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html,"Las Vegas, Nevada",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Comfortable stay with a basic pyramid queen room,"I got to the hotel at 3 pm and there was a large line for check in. It went rather quickly and the gentleman that checked me in did so with ease. I did not get any upgrades, so stayed in the queen pyramid room and found the room to be clean and comfortable. There was a safe in the room, but no fridge or microwave. They had a menu for room service with decent pricing on it; however, I did not partake in room service. The Luxor is located on the extreme south end of the strip, so there is a considerable amount of walking when you plan to go to the action in the central strip, but it is a very budget friendly place to be and I would stay there again. I did not use the pool; however, I did go out and check it out. It was the end of March, so only one pool was open and it is rather small, so if I was to be going there in the summer and wanted to spend significant time at the pool, I don't believe this is where I would stay for that. Altogether, a good stay for the cost.",March 2019,Luxor Hotel & Casino,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g45963-d111709-Reviews-Luxor_Hotel_Casino-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html,"Las Vegas, Nevada",hotels,4.0,3.5
Excellent breakfast!,"I was a bit skeptical of going to the Luxor buffet after reading all the reviews on it, but chose to do breakfast because I figured it was really hard to mess that up, right? Well, fortunately, I had a wonderful experience there. They had a small line when I arrived that went through the cashier and was seated very timely. The buffet had a lot of the same stuff on it from section to section, but plenty of what you would expect for a typical American breakfast. They had a gentleman who was making fresh omelettes at a station and they were fantastic. The bacon was fresh and crispy and everything else was fresh and made well and there was plenty of fresh fruit. I couldn't say anything bad about the breakfast I had while there. I would definitely go back there again.",March 2019,The Buffet at Luxor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g45963-d422882-Reviews-The_Buffet_at_Luxor-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html,"Las Vegas, Nevada",restaurants,5.0,3.5

Prepare for stairs and amazing views!,"I am a very active individual, so I didn't mind the stairs, but there are several of them to get to the rooms. The breakfast is acceptable here and their breakfast area is delightful to sit at morning, noon, and night. The view of the ocean is amazing. The general store two doors down has all the bottled water and drinks you could want to put in the fridge in your room. The public bus stops right down the street from you to take you into town for very cheap. The only complaint I have with this place is that the beds are like rocks. Very, very firm. I like firm, but this was beyond firm. The beach right in front of the hotel is very nice. Just know the umbrellas and chairs cost $15 Euros for the day even if you are staying at the hotel. However, they are more expensive at other beaches on the island, so this was acceptable.",September 2018,Alkistis Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g805388-d250637-Reviews-Alkistis_Hotel-Agios_Stefanos_Mykonos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Mykonos, Greece",hotels,4.0,3.5

Very nice experience,"We were not sure how this was going to go due to the mixed reviews on this place, however, we got there and had a very pleasant experience. The staff was timely, and the food was excellent. The price was not as bad as we were expecting, but the thing that will blow you away with this place is the views. We went there right before sunset and was able to see the whole city as we sat on their balcony outside. We watched the sun go down and then watched the city light up as well as having an excellent view of the Parthenon at the Acropolis light up.

On time,"Our flight was on time and the seats in the plane were brand new (although there is no recline to them anymore). The flights are inexpensive, but they nickel and dime you after you book your ticket. They make you pay to get assigned seats, they make you pay to get carry on luggage on with you, and they even make you pay to get anything to eat or drink on the plane.

"Nice rooms, very busy pools, and expensive food.","We stayed at the MGM Grand for 3 nights and there were positives and negatives to our stay, but overall we enjoyed it. First of all, the location is great for lots of things on the strip and it is close to the airport. Our room was 2 queens, strip view and we were happy with the room. The bed was very comfortable, and the pillows were thick and awesome. The bathroom was nice, but the shower in the early evenings was difficult to adjust water temperatures. We were either cold or very hot in the shower and spent too much time adjusting the temps. Maybe if you shower at a different time of day it would be better?
The pool area is absolutely packed by 11am every day and it got more packed as the day went on. This is not the place to go if you are looking for a relaxing time at the pool. It is definitely more of a party scene, and if you want loungers together, get out there early.
The restaurants are plentiful, but we only ate at the food court once, and Fiamma's once. I will rate Fiamma's separate, but the food court was terrible for breakfast, but cheapest option in the hotel. We ate at Denny's for breakfast one day which was our best option about a block down the street from the hotel.
The drinks at the pool are expensive, but they don't allow you to take more than one drink into the place with you, so you are expected to buy drinks there. Water, even at the vending machines, are $3.25, so expect to pay here.
Checking in was no problem, but checking out, I noticed that they didn't give me my food and beverage credit that they were supposed to. So, if you are offered that when you book, make sure they credit you for it. Also, only certain restaurants and bars are covered on that food and beverage credit voucher, so make sure you eat or drink at the right locations to have that covered.
Overall, I would stay here again because they have a lot of positives over the little negatives that they have here. But, just make sure you bring lots of money.",July 2018,MGM Grand Las Vegas,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g45963-d91891-Reviews-MGM_Grand_Las_Vegas-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html,"Las Vegas, Nevada",hotels,4.0,4.0
Amazing burgers,"This place is very easy to find and very attractive exterior due to it being right on the Vegas strip. They don't have near the interior attractions that I have seen at many other Hard Rock Cafe's. We were quick to be seated and quick to be served. We ordered burgers since they are ""legendary"" here.

Tom Keifer Rocked the House!,"We didn't come here to bowl, but we did come here for a Tom Keifer show that played here. Tickets were only $30 to get in and the venue is a great place for a show. The stage is nice and big with enough of a lift to it that short people like me don't have a hard time seeing. It was not too loud, but sounded just right.

I have eaten here many times and noticed that their portion sizes have shrunk over the last couple of years though.

This resort is absolutely beautiful.,"I stayed at this resort for 6 nights. There are so many things that are wonderful about the resort and very little that they could improve on. The check in process was very easy and when we got to the resort we did not have any line at all. We did decide to upgrade to preferred and it was well worth every penny. The rooms had nothing else to desire. They were very comfortable and had all necessities in the room that you would expect from any other resort. The landscaping at this place was immaculate. The adults only preferred pool is very beautiful and quiet if you like to get away from the little ones on the resort. However, we did go to the infinity pool often as well. It was where some of the action was at and they did have a very fun St. Patty's Day foam party there. The adult only preferred beach area is also a huge plus. The wait staff on the beach were excellent. We loved the beach, instead of just sand and palapas, they have several trees lining the area giving shade throughout the day and the sounds of the leaves rustling with the breeze and the ocean rolling in just steps from our chairs was very relaxing. The beach is swimmable, although there are a few rocks here and there so water shoes might not be a bad idea.

The nightly entertainment was good. We have seen a lot of cheesy entertainment at resorts, but this group does a good job at providing entertainment for all. There are constantly things going on throughout the day to keep you busy if you choose, although the entertainment staff is not pushy so if you want to relax all day you can.

The staff is very friendly at this resort, although since we only speak English there were times when we had a bit of a language barrier as the staff speak basic words in several languages, English is not their 1st language. There were times when we could not get through exactly what we may have been asking about, but it was never a deal breaker for anything that we did and we never did without.

If there was any reason that I did not give this place a 5 star rating it was that the food was good, but not great. We did have some good dishes at each restaurant, but never was blown away with the choices we tried at each restaurant (there are plenty).

If I was to come to the area, I would definitely consider staying here again.

Don't listen to the negative reviews. Great place for the money.,"We arrived at 3:30pm on a Friday and only had to wait on two guests to check in ahead of us. The rooms are comfortable with everything you need. The bathroom is a bit small for two people to stand in at the same time, but nothing to be too concerned about. The beach is to die for. It is absolutely stunning! Whitest sand I have ever seen and I have been on a lot of beaches in my day. The water there is so calm that you feel like you are swimming in a pool and you do not have to use water shoes as the sand is soft even in the water with few rocks/shells. There is a lot of watersport activities to do in the area and you are right beside all the restaurants and shops just outside your doors. There are several places around that have good happy hour prices so drinks are not too expensive, and the food is good everywhere we went. The palapa reservation system just stinks, but the staff comes over and plays games with you to entertain you while you wait in the shade and you can take that time to get to know the other travelers around you. We did not find the entertainment to be too exciting, so if you are looking for that, you may have to leave the hotel, but it sure is a great place to stay for the budget cost it gives you. I met at least 3 people there that have been coming there for years (since the mid 80's) and have stayed at other resorts on the island but always come back to the HI as they say that it was the best bang for your buck.

The only regret I have is that I live so far away that I can't make it back, but if ever in the area again would stop again.",October 2016,Teddy's Barn and Grill,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g29356-d3509898-Reviews-Teddy_s_Barn_and_Grill-Anamosa_Iowa.html,"Anamosa, Iowa",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Hidden Gem,"This is a very basic hotel with only the necessities in your room, but everything you could need with an unbelievably inexpensive cost. The owner is a very nice, helpful gentleman who will take care of your every need. I am very picky when it comes to hotels and this one is one not to miss. The views here are beautiful, the food in the restaurant is outstanding, and the lemoncello is the best! Book here you won't be sorry!",September 2016,Il Nido Hotel Sorrento,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187782-d205448-Reviews-Il_Nido_Hotel_Sorrento-Sorrento_Province_of_Naples_Campania.html,"Sorrento, Italy",hotels,5.0,4.5
