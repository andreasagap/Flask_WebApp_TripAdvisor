Great Food,"We visited this restaurant with friends, on their recommendation. I had never even heard of it, but I'm glad we came.

It was Friday evening and we arrived at 6 pm with a reservation. The place was quite empty when we arrived but within 30 minutes it was full! Timing is everything.

I generally try out the fish and chips at least once wherever I go, so that immediately got my attention. It was very nicely done, a single large fillet that was lightly battered and crispy without being overcooked. The fries were also crispy and delicious. My wife opted for the burger, it is a substantial portion and she quite liked it. I tasted a bite, there is a unique flavor to the burger and I still can't put my finger on the spice, but it was very tasty.

Service was very friendly and the food arrived amazingly fast.

All in all a very nice evening.",October 2020,Free Bird,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g6826465-d17426336-Reviews-Free_Bird-Lumsden_Saskatchewan.html,"Lumsden, Canada",restaurants,5.0,5.0
Wow!,"Made this hike on the recommendation of friends and loved it. From the parking lot it was a fairly easy 8 km hike in just under 3 hours, which included lots of gawking and picture taking. My first exposure to Wells Gray, and I need to come back!",September 2020,Helmcken Falls,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g182209-d254960-Reviews-Helmcken_Falls-Clearwater_British_Columbia.html,"Clearwater, Canada",attractions,5.0,4.5
Mmmm Goodness,"After hiking the rim trail to Helmcken Falls our group of 4 was ready for some grub, and Hop n Hog was a great was to end the day.

We arrived about 8 pm and while things appeared to be thinning out we still needed to wait about 20 minutes for a table. Thanks to COVID we would have preferred an outside table but had to settle for inside, but table use was spaced out widely and all was good. Service was quick and friendly, just like it should be.

My wife and I ordered the pulled pork mac n cheese and a smoked combo plate with brisket and chicken, to share. The combo plate was delicious, but we found the mac n cheese a little lacking. Maybe on it's own it would have been fine, but when competing with the smoked meat flavors it came up short. Not bad, but not 'jump off the plate' goodness either. Next time I will pass on the mac n cheese and pick something else.

Prices seemed a bit higher than I expected ($22 and $32 for the mains) but this is good food in the middle of nowhere with a short season, so probably not out of line.",September 2020,Hop N Hog Tap & Smokehouse,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g182209-d8060869-Reviews-Hop_N_Hog_Tap_Smokehouse-Clearwater_British_Columbia.html,"Clearwater, Canada",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Great Ride!,"This has been on our radar for a while and we finally made the trek. It had threatened rain in the morning which thinned the crowds substantially and made the 11 km ride to Ruth Station and back quite a bit more enjoyable. Given that most of the trestles are only wide enough for single file I can see how large crowds would make for slow going, so it is definitely worth timing your visit for off-peak times.

The last few km's of the road are gravel which is rough in places, but certainly manageable in any kind of vehicle.

This was well worth the effort to visit and ride.",September 2020,Myra Canyon Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g154933-d2233786-Reviews-Myra_Canyon_Park-Kelowna_Okanagan_Valley_British_Columbia.html,"Kelowna, Canada",attractions,5.0,5.0
Great first visit,"We joined some friends for a pint and a burger after biking the nearby trestle rail trail, and it was lovely. The place was mostly empty inside but we were able to find an open table outside - which was our preference. The burgers were great, the beer cold, and service quick and friendly. And the views on the patio not to shabby either! The cost for everything was $100 after taxes but before tip. Quite reasonable and delicious.",September 2020,McCulloch Station Pub,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g154933-d784178-Reviews-McCulloch_Station_Pub-Kelowna_Okanagan_Valley_British_Columbia.html,"Kelowna, Canada",restaurants,5.0,3.5
"Well, that's a first...","Now that we are slowly getting back into visiting restaurants during the pandemic, it's been really nice to see how everyone has adjusted procedures to keep customers safe. Unfortunately this business missed the mark. Twice.

Since we are pulling our camper the drive-through was not an option for us and we had no choice to go in. I always avoid the self-order terminals (minimizes risk) and go to the counter. But with a single entry door and the first self-order terminal right inside the door it's hard not to brush anyone at the terminal when you walk it. Definitely no 6 ft separation possible there!

While waiting for our order of breakfast meals and coffee I had time to watch the staff behind the counter. All were masked and working quite efficiently, but I couldn't help but notice one young guy filling order bags. He first grabbed the outside centre of his mask and pulled it down over his chin while standing over the food, then a minute later pulled it back up over his mouth (not his nose) and reached down to grab the last of the sandwiches and fries and plop them into a bag. Our bag. All without sanitizing his hands. When he delivered our order to the counter I pointed out his lack of proper procedure and refused to touch the order, which they then remade for us. I realize that wearing a mask is not normal for most of us, and resisting the temptation to not handle it is incredibly tough. But it's essential now that we seem to be living with COVID for the long haul.

On the upside, the food was great once we got it.",September 2020,McDonald's,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g181773-d4868448-Reviews-McDonald_s-Salmon_Arm_British_Columbia.html,"Salmon Arm, Canada",restaurants,1.0,3.5
So So...,"First visit here for my wife and I, and I would say it was average. COVID precautions were adequate, and that was nice to see, and service was very friendly. But the place feels pretty worn, and thought the prices a bit high. All we had were a couple omelletes and coffees and the bill was $40 before tip.

So, pretty average.",August 2020,Ricky's All Day Grill,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g154919-d981267-Reviews-Ricky_s_All_Day_Grill-Lethbridge_Alberta.html,"Lethbridge, Canada",restaurants,3.0,3.5
First visit - mixed reviews,"Based on previous reviews and proximity to the RV park we are staying in, we decided to stop here for a late dinner on Monday night. Upon arriving at 7:30 pm we were told they were closing at 8 pm (something not noted on their website, which I checked before arrival) and were only offerring a limited menu.

So we quickly made our choices, only to be informed a few minutes later that my wife would need to change her order: they were out of chicken breasts and couldn't provide the chicken burger she requested. So the limited menu was even more limited! Chicken is a pretty basic item, who runs out of that?

In the end, both my fish and chips and her stacked burger were delicious, the price was quite reasonable ($41 total before tax and tip, including 1 beer), their COVID precautions were spot on, and the service by Rachel was very good.

Had it not been for the surprise hours and the lack of chicken this visit would have been worth at least a 4, maybe even 5.",August 2020,Brandts Creek Neighborhood Pub,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g154933-d774575-Reviews-Brandts_Creek_Neighborhood_Pub-Kelowna_Okanagan_Valley_British_Columbia.html,"Kelowna, Canada",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Great Location and Facility,"Based on a previous recommendation we stayed here for 4 nights and loved it. This adult oriented park has a number of rules about noise, etc that may seem restrictive to some, but we loved it. It was very quiet and exceedingly well kept. Staff were always super friendly and were always out and about prepping sites between visitors, mowing and watering lawns, and generally keeping an eye on things. We had a great visit and would happily stay here again.",August 2020,Kootenay River RV Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g181791-d6921872-Reviews-Kootenay_River_RV_Park-Castlegar_Kootenay_Rockies_British_Columbia.html,"Castlegar, Canada",hotels,5.0,5.0
Great Find,"After several hours of cycling on the nearby Slocan Rail Trail we decided to grab a late lunch here, for no other reason than proximity to the trailhead.

Our group of 6 all ordered various paninis (the Wally, Reuben or Melted Brie) and were all pleased with both the quality and quantity. Judging by all the toys and play equipment, they go out of their way to cater to young families, although that wasn't of interest to us.

Cost was in the range of $35-40 per couple.",August 2020,Frog Peak Cafe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g4263275-d3605651-Reviews-Frog_Peak_Cafe-Crescent_Valley_Kootenay_Rockies_British_Columbia.html,"Crescent Valley, Canada",restaurants,4.0,4.5
First Time....,"I'm not sure why, but despite our annual visits to RMNP and Onanole for the last several years this was our first visit to Barnaby's. As mentioned by other reviewers, this is a place you need to judge by the food and service and not by the facility.

It's in a somewhat tired old building decorated like your grand parents kitchen circa 1950 (or great-grandparents, depending on your age...). It's been a long time since I've seen such an eclectic collection of kitchen chairs, but I found it added to the ambience. It has character!

But what about the food? Most comments we'd heard about this place related to the chicken and ribs so my wife and I each decided to give the ribs a shot. Service was friendly and welcoming, and they were taking their COVID precautions seriously. The food arrived very quickly and was piping hot, and the serving size substantial. We had mentioned to our server that it was our first visit and he said the cook gave us a larger portion than usual in recognition of that. Yikes! After reading a previous review I was hoping to give the sticky toffee pudding a try, but there was no way I could handle it. The fall-off-the-bone ribs were very tasty, and excellent value given the price.

It was a hot day and we each had a beer (or two..) and these were the least expensive restaurant beer prices I've seen in a while. Almost half some of the other restaurants in town.

We will be back next year!",August 2020,Barnaby's Grille,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g499166-d763483-Reviews-Barnaby_s_Grille-Onanole_Manitoba.html,"Onanole, Canada",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Tuesday Half price wings!,"Our group of 6 made our annual pilgrimage to Buffalo bar for beer/wine and half price wings on Tuesday night. As always the wings were hot and tasty, and the service was good. Traffic on this evening was steady and they were mostly full, although their seating is reduced due to COVID. We will be back!",August 2020,Buffalo Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g499166-d10058444-Reviews-Buffalo_Bar-Onanole_Manitoba.html,"Onanole, Canada",restaurants,4.0,3.5
Time for our annual visit,"We have a thing for wood fired pizza and always like to make a stop at Foxtail during our annual visit to RMNP.

Our server was Brett, and he was quite friendly, helpful and attentive. It was a Friday evening about 7 and they were not overly busy, and we were seated inside (our choice) at a table near the pizza oven. This was great, since I love to watch the action in that area.

We each ordered a drink and a pizza (I had the Duke and my wife the Summer Savory), both were excellent. We couldn't finish them and had to pass on dessert.

Service was very quick, we had left our campsite in the park at 7 and by 8 we were settling up our bill! Given our location we could see folks arriving at the outside tables and then see their pizza's come out of the oven and get served to them, and their service was just as quick as ours.

The only downside was that I found things pricier than I remember, and more than I think its worth. Beer was $9, wine $12 and each pizza $25. With taxes but before tip the bill was $80. I don't recall what individual items were priced at last year, but it seems they are making up their COVID losses through higher prices.",August 2020,Foxtail Cafe Needs Mrmu,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g499166-d4453110-Reviews-Foxtail_Cafe_Needs_Mrmu-Onanole_Manitoba.html,"Onanole, Canada",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Wow! Just wow!,"Visited this restaurant with friends who were enjoying RMNP for the first time. With the pandemic we haven't eaten out very much in recent months and we weren't sure how they were handling precautions. But we needent have worried, everything was great. Lots of hand sanitizer available, tables widely spaced, all staff using masks, and table sanitizing was evident.

We were seated at a table next to the windows with a great view of the lake. Service was very friendly, and we found the prices more than reasonable. I enjoyed the ribs and my wife had the pickerel, both were fabulous. In fact, this may be one of the best meals we had in years. We topped it off with excellent cheesecake and chocolate mousse with pistachios. Mmmmm

Flavorful and economical,"I reserve 5 star ratings for places with wow! factor, places that deliver more than I expect.

Our group of 4 came based on favourable reviews from friends, and we were not disappointed. It was a Monday evening and we came early, having heard it can be quite busy at times. We had nothing to worry about, it was only starting to fill up at 7 when we left.

Service was quick and pleasant, portion sizes were quite adequate, and the food was very flavourable. We would highly recommend the chicken mo mo starter (which has a modest amount of heat), prawn noodles, coconut chicken, fish manchurian, and aloogobi mutter. All were quite different and excellent. The only thing not quite to my taste was the mango kulfi dessert which was not as sweet and I expected for a dessert and had an odd chalky texture.

It is worth noting they are not yet licensed and can't serve alcohol, although we were told by our server that they hope to be soon.

The total cost for all 4 of us was under $80 before tip, which is very reasonable and excellent value. This was a great experience and well worth the drive.

Service?,"I actually forgot this franchise existed here and decided to stop on impulse as I drove by. This will likely be the last time I do that.

After the person ahead of me was served I stepped up to the till to order an ice cap and sour cream glazed, only to have the staff person walk away for several minutes and then call people in line behind me be served at the other till! Huh? After flagging someone down I finally got served.

Takeout is the way to go,"Unless you enjoy standing in line (with a fabulous view mind you) the secret is to call and order takeout. Eat either in your nearby unit or at one of the tables by the pool.

If you do want to eat inside, they do churn folks through pretty fast and the food is consistently good. I'm always a sucker for the mac nut pancakes or the omelettes. After watching the lines for 2 weeks from our unit in Napili Shores, it seems they were the shortest around 11:30 am or 1:30 pm (they close at 2). If you want to be in the first seating when they open at 7:30 you will need to be there before 7:00.",February 2020,Gazebo Restaurant at Napili Shores,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60634-d404362-Reviews-Gazebo_Restaurant_at_Napili_Shores-Lahaina_Maui_Hawaii.html,"Maui, Hawaii",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Another great visit,"This was our 5th visit to Napili Shores and we intend to be back for more. It is the only place in Maui we would consider staying.

Some rooms can be booked through Outrigger, but many are only available directly from the owners - usually through VRBO or Home Away. Over the years we have stayed in studio and 1 bedroom units, with either ocean-front, ocean-view, and Garden-view units. Because all are individually owned they each have their own character despite a common design and many common elements.

Location matters when it comes to noise: garden view units have better access to the rear pool but also have the noise that accompanies it, depending on location the 1-bedroom units will have parking lot noise to contend with (the bedrooms are at the back), and the sound of the surf in the ocean front units (buildings 'A' and 'I') can be disconcerting if you are not prepared for it when the surf is high. All have full kitchens and bathrooms with showers, and the grounds are impeccable. The Gazebo restaurant and Kitchen 5315 are both onsite, as is the Waterworks store for rentals of snorkel gear and water toys.

However, the proximity to both Napili and Kapalua beaches and honokena cove, and the more laid back atmosphere of west Maui makes this our go-to location.",February 2020,Napili Shores Maui by Outrigger,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60634-d87315-Reviews-Napili_Shores_Maui_by_Outrigger-Lahaina_Maui_Hawaii.html,"Maui, Hawaii",hotels,4.0,4.0
Another great meal,"This was our second visit to this restaurant, and I think it will become a tradition to always make this our last meal in Maui before leaving the island. Everything was wonderful: garlic noodles, steamed pork buns, tempura shrimp, taro dumplings, and of course the Malasadas for dessert. And the service was very quick and friendly.

Didn't expect to find this!,"With high surf warnings all along the coast we decided it was a good day to circumnavigate the west end of the island. We stopped to check out the Karen Leis gallery and were pleased to find Bay View located in the parking lot. On the spur of the moment we decided to grab lunch while we were there. On the recommendation of the vendor we ordered the fish tacos and the teriyaki burger,and both were delicious. Portion sizes were not huge, but adequate, and the service was excellent. It took about 10-15 minutes to get our order and everything tasted like it was fresh cooked. Given the views and availability of seating, the wait was quite enjoyable!

Fish and chips,"I was flying solo one evening, and since this restaurant is within Napili Shores resort where I'm staying I thought was a safe and quick alternative. I have a weak spot for fish and chips so I had to give that a try. They were panko crusted and a bit crunchy but nicely cooked inside. Portion size was adequate, the fish was cut into strips or sticks, rather than being a larger flat fillet. Service was very quick and friendly, so no complaints there.

Overall I would say this was quite an adequate meal, although nothing spectacular. I rated it a 3 because it met my expectations but didn't provide any wow factor.

Great breakfast,"This was my first visit to this place for breakfast or lunch, although we have been there for dinner on occasion (at Luna, the sister restaurant). I was more impressed with their morning food service, although I must say I remain disappointed in their furnishings. I'm not sure anything has changed from when the original restaurant in this location decorated years ago. In particular I find the seats uncomfortable, after thousands of bums it's time for replacements!

As soon as we were seated our server was there to inform us that due to the crowd the kitchen was backed up and it may be 20-30 minutes to get our food. While we waited the coffee and water were repeatedly filled and the time passed quickly, so the wait wasn't a big deal. Again, our server made repeated stops to make sure we we're looked after. When I queried her about the crowd and the delay, I was informed this was normal on Saturday and Sunday mornings. If it's normal, then I'm not sure why they made it sound extraordinary, or why they can't staff and manage it better in the kitchen.

When the food arrived it was hot and very good. I had the sizzler (which is a very sizeable portion), while others in our group either had eggs Benedict, bacon and eggs or an omelet. Everyone commented favourably on the portion sizes and quality.

An Excellent Day!!,"I just realized I failed to submit a review of our walking tour in early October so this is coming in a month late.

For our group of 14 we booked a private ""Total Bucharest Tour” which was a combination of their two most popular tours (Bohemian and Discovery). While we researched it on TA we booked directly through their corporate website, and it was apparent through our discussions they are quite amenable to creating one-off tours when asked.

We had 2 guides that day, both named Andrei, and they provided an excellent experience. They met us and started/ended our tour at the Volo Hotel, and adapted it as we went. The tour included a variety of back streets and out of the way places, in addition to regular stops like the market and the old-town. Both Andrei's were very frank in their comments about their city and its recent and not so recent historical influences. Our group loved all the information, but also really valued the variety of food and drink we were exposed to as well. We strongly believe that culture is often best reflected in its food, so this is a priority for us.

This combined tour made for a long day, but it was worth it!

Amazing!,"This restaurant was highly recommended to us by our Urban Adventures tour guide (Tavi) so we just had to check it out. It lived up to our expectations.

I ordered the duck dish and my wife had the pork and sour cabbage. Both were very good with excellent presentation. We finished with the cockscomb rice pudding (think rooster...) which was delicious but unlike anything I've had before. Try it!

Another good visit,"Three of us stopped in for dinner and were not dissappointed. Despite being a Monday evening just after 6 pm the place was full so we sat and ordered in the bar. Everything we ordered was excellent: korean cauliflower and tempura beans for appie's, and the steak wedge salad, carbonara mac and cheese, and Thai pasta for mains.

While the history and decor of this place is remarkable, we found the food to be average. I ordered the fish and chips, it arrived hot and the fish was lightly battered and nicely cooked, but the 'chips' were actually battered and deep fried chunks of potato, not what I was expecting at all. My wife had the teriyaki chicken with rice, it was also piping hot and the chicken was nicely cooked, but was nothing spectacular. On the recommendation of the waiter (Josh?) I ordered the Bluebird mud pie for dessert, apparently their most popular dessert. While it was good, nothing distinguished it from mud-pie I have eaten at any number of other places.

Service was also a bit unusual. We we're served reasonably quickly but when it came time to clear the plates on 2 occasions our server reached to remove them and then pulled back and walked away. I finally moved them myself after he delivered dessert. Huh?

Nice food and atmosphere,"On a recommendation we decided the 4 if us would have dinner. The location in a residential neighborhood was a bit of a surprise, but the place was full when we arrived at 6:30 for dinner.

Service was very pleasant and reasonably quick. We ordered the Brussels sprouts and pork perogies for share for appetizers and moved on to mains of either the lamb burger, pasta, curried rockfish and the trout. All were excellent.

Service was quick and friendly and I would be happy to return at some point in the future.",October 2019,Trestle Tavern,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60922-d10622707-Reviews-Trestle_Tavern-Salt_Lake_City_Utah.html,"Salt Lake City, Utah",restaurants,4.0,3.5
Great little coffee shop,"On a local recomendation we popped in here on a Saturday afternoon for a coffee. This is a nice little shop with an experienced barista. But with only 1 staff person on it's not a high-speed or high volume operation. If there a few people ahead you expect a bit of a wait for your brew. As with many similar shops, I find the barista lingo a bit pretentious. I just want a good cup of coffee - and on that front they deliver.",October 2019,Wasatch Roasting Company,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g57090-d15175371-Reviews-Wasatch_Roasting_Company-Ogden_Utah.html,"Ogden, Utah",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Quick overnight stop,"Just a quick overnight as we were passing through the city. It was good value with good access to the highways, was friendly and clean with a comfortable bed. Some things we're showing their age (frayed towels), but otherwise everything worked (microwave, fridge, blow dryer, etc.).",October 2019,MountainView Lodge & Suites,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g45095-d488271-Reviews-MountainView_Lodge_Suites-Bozeman_Montana.html,"Bozeman, Montana",hotels,4.0,4.0
"Nice room, slightly better cleaning needed","Our group overnighted at this hotel because of it's convenient location and free shuttle to the airport.

The rooms were nicely appointed with a comfortable bed and good shower. Typical for European hotels, there were no sheets, only duvet's. Also typical for this time of year the AC was off and the fan seemed to pump out endless heat regardless of the temperature setting. As a result I simply turned the system off and opened a window to cool things down. This worked fine until the airplanes came in overhead - remember the proximity to the airport? Yeah, they were loud!

Cleaning, however, left a bit to be desired. Clearly their vacuuming missed things on the floor, and there were sticky rings from glasses on some of the surfaces near the TV. Little things, but that is what makes all the difference when done we'll. (Also the primary reason for my 'average' rating.)

The shuttle runs to the airport very hour on the hour, but they have the capacity to run more than 1 vehicle at a time to accommodate larger numbers of people. There were so many people leaving at 6 am along with us they actually ran 3 trips.

Our group ate dinner in the Cristal reataurant onsite, and quite enjoyed it. There are 2 restaurants on site, Rustic, which is more rustic and family focused, and Cristal which appeared higher end and more refined. The service and food were good, and the wait staff spoke English. The only downside was their refusal to allow us to create 1 large table for all 14 of us, apparently they have a 'rule' that limits groups to 8. Portions sizes were adequate, and I didn't hear any complaints about the quality of the food.",October 2019,Rin Airport Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g298476-d2140238-Reviews-Rin_Airport_Hotel-Otopeni_Ilfov_County_Southern_Romania.html,"Otopeni, Romania",hotels,3.0,4.0
Wow!,"Harvest Eatery has been on my radar for a couple years, but I so rarely drive through Shaunavon that I wasn't sure when I might get there. Today the stars aligned and we were able to get out of Regina in time to arrive for lunch before they closed at 1:30 (they open again later for dinner).

I started with their soup of the day (the most unique borscht I've ever had) while my wife has the wonton soup. The Cacio e Pepe pasta was my main of choice while my wife opted for the Harvest bowl with feta substituted for the blue cheese. All of these dishes were quite unique and very flavorful.

The service was also outstanding. All 3 of the staff came by at one point or another and everything was seamless. They were friendly, informative and attentive. The food arrived quickly and very hot. Oh, and the fresh press coffee as delicious - even served with a timer so you know when its ready!

The layout of the restaurant is interesting, from my seat I had a great view of the kitchen prep area which is pretty much in the centre of the room, and it was a delight to watch.

This may be one of the more expensive lunches we've had, but is worth every penny! Now I just need to find a reason to be back in their neighborhood ......",October 2019,Harvest Eatery and Fresh Market,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g3834927-d4609507-Reviews-Harvest_Eatery_and_Fresh_Market-Shaunavon_Saskatchewan.html,"Shaunavon, Canada",restaurants,5.0,5.0
Great meals,"We recently stayed for a week and our group had 3 meals in the hotel restaurant (2 dinners and 1 lunch). We found the staff to be very pleasant, accommodating and attentive, although they did not always get our orders right. We attributed this to the language barrier (we spoke no Romanian and they spoke minimal English). The food we received was for the most part excellent, with only 1 or 2 average pasta dishes among the selection. I would have problems returning to this restaurant based on these experiences.",October 2019,Restaurant Hotel Palace,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g3208755-d16904152-Reviews-Restaurant_Hotel_Palace-Baile_Govora_Valcea_County_Southwest_Romania.html,"Baile Govora, Romania",restaurants,4.0,3.5
"All the ingredients for success, but.....","We were the leaders of a group that stayed in this hotel for a week, so we not only had our own experiences here but heard about the experiences in several other rooms.

On the upside, this is a beautiful 100 year old property that must have been a real gem in it's early days. It has been reasonably well restored and at first glance looks wonderful. It is a large property on the edge of a very nice park area (with nice walking trails), so is well situated for a relaxing stay.

The rooms vary in size and on the surface appear quite nice, but once you settle in you realize that maintenance is required. In our case there were a few issues: the mattress was lumpy and fell off to the edge of bed; there was always water on the floor of the bathroom, either from the tub or toilet, or both, it varied; the heater was either on full or off with no in-between settings that we could figure, consequently we left if off all week and had the windows open constantly to cool things down; and room cleaning was minimal - garbage was removed daily, but there was only 1 towel change and no bedding changes all week and the in-room glasses were never replaced after use. These experiences were similar to others in our group, so this was clearly their standard practice.

One of our greatest frustrations related to the spa services. Our group intended to make use of the massage therapists on our last morning before leaving the hotel, when we inquired weeks ahead about bookings for a dozen of us we were told 'no problem, make reservations at check in'. Once we arrived we discovered they had only 1 therapist with a total of 5 twenty minute time slots! It took 4 days of disjointed discussions for them to inform us they had added more staff and hours for the morning we needed. And we immediately booked them solid.

It became very apparent over the week that none of the staff have any authority to address any issues raised by customers. They always defer to an invisible 'higher authority' that is both absent and indecisive. I have rarely encountered a hotel so disinterested in serving it's customers needs and making more sales.

On the positive side, though, we had several meals in the restaurant and found the staff there to be quite accommodating and attentive, and we enjoyed some wonderful meals.

This hotel has great potential. With a little attention to maintenance and a better managemt approach that empowers it's staff to actually serve its customers, this could easily be worth a 5 rating. But not now.",October 2019,Hotel Palace,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g3208755-d4509119-Reviews-Hotel_Palace-Baile_Govora_Valcea_County_Southwest_Romania.html,"Baile Govora, Romania",hotels,3.0,3.5
