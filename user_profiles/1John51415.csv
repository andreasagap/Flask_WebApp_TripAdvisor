Come here for steaks.,"We ordered a ribeye steak each, shoe string potatoes, creamed spinach, a salad, one blood sausage (for me to sample), a bottle of Malbec and a dessert. The salad was fresh, crisp and delicious, blood sausage was not what I expected, the shoe string potatoes were perfect in size and well fried, creamed spinach was delicious (not too creamy) and the ribeye steaks were superbly done medium. Our food and the Malbec recommended by our waiter paired well. For dessert we shared ice cream with dulce de leche, which was a great end to our meal. Despite the fact that we did not speak any Spanish and our waiter spoke very little English, the service was very good. I recommend this restaurant for Argentinian steaks.

Terrible service!,"My husband and I went to Bank's because it was recommended to us. His clam chowder had lots of potatoes and hardly any clams. When we asked our server about it, his reply was ""that's the way it is"". My husband ordered a white wine and that was not served until after our entrees were served by another waiter. He asked the second waiter about his white wine but the second waiter simply ignored us and walked away.
After speaking to the manager about the appalling service, she apologised but never return to see how our meal was. It was bad dining experience for us. I do not recommend this restaurant.

"Ambiance, Tasty food and Great service","This was our first visit to this restaurant. My husband's steak was more rare than he liked. Shane, the manager, came to our table to ask how we were and my husband told him about his steak. Immediately Shane asked if he wanted a new steak and salad. He asked for his steak to be cooked a little more and new salad. That was served 5 minutes later. Our hanger steaks were well seasoned and our salads were very fresh. At different times, both Shane and Tony (our waiter) came over to inquired about our steaks. Before we asked for the bill, Shane surprised us by placing their signature dessert (salted caramel cheesecake with a dollop of vanilla ice cream) on our table. That was delicious.

Inedible curry,"Having read good reviews about Thanying, we went there for dinner. Beef in the curry main dish was so over cooked that it was inedible. We returned that dish and our dining experience was ruined. The prices are not cheap but that curry dish tasted bad. There was also an air of snobbiness.",January 2017,Thanying,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293916-d1491803-Reviews-Thanying-Bangkok.html,"Bangkok, Thailand",restaurants,2.0,4.0
Location and Lana style,"After a night at a terrible hotel (more like a hostel in disguise), we went in search for another hotel to stay. We walked to 3 other hotels and have the staff show us the rooms before choosing Kodchasri Thani. We got a good price for our room, which included a daily breakfast buffet. Every morning we will eat breakfast outside by the pool, which has many potted orchids of various colours. Our room was comfortable for 3 nights and quiet. Being near the Old Town made it easy for us to walk and explore this charming city. The front desk staff was helpful and pleasant.",January 2017,Kodchasri Thani Chiang Mai,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293917-d1964900-Reviews-Kodchasri_Thani_Chiang_Mai-Chiang_Mai.html,"Chiang Mai, Thailand",hotels,4.0,4.5
An exhilarating one day trek,"Since both my partner and I enjoy hiking we decided to go on a full day trek. It started with a ride to the Anka village and from there we hiked to various terrains and we saw rubber trees, wild papaya trees, banana plantation, waterfall, etc. The trek comprised of flat, to steep uphill to crossing brooks and walking along rice fields. Lunch was at our guide's house in his Lahu village. We had pork with snow peas, stir fried eggplant, jasmine rice and fresh cut pineapple for dessert. To spice up our food, we were given homemade chili - hot! At the end of our lunch we had a delightful time seeing our guide relaxed with his wife, son and baby grandson, before we continued our hike. Towards the end of our trek, our guide stopped us when he heard bells. It was a mahout riding his elephant after a day's work. We were thrilled to see a working elephant passed us by. On our way back to Chiang Rai we were driven to a place where we soaked our tired feet in thermal water. A final stop was at the Big Buddha temple where we climbed up to the highest part of the pagoda. Our guide made bamboo cups & rings for each of us, which became our reminder of an enjoyable and exhilarating trek. Do wear a hat, sunglasses, breathable long sleeve shirts and trousers. Bring a day pack that has insect repellent, wet wipes, tissues and lots of water to drink.",January 2017,Lanna Trek,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297920-d2516635-Reviews-Lanna_Trek-Chiang_Rai_Chiang_Rai_Province.html,"Chiang Rai, Thailand",attractions,4.0,5.0
Tom Yum Pizza anyone?,Partner needed a pizza. He got his fix and I ate the Tom Yum pizza (Thai taste). Both of our pizzas accompanied by good cold beers were tasty.

AVOID THIS PLACE,"The reviews do not match the property. For the same price you can stay at a hotel that includes breakfast and at a good location. Villa Duang Champa's price does not include breakfast. Their wifi is terrible. Our room is very, very, basic and is comparable to a 2 star hotel at best. For the same price you can find other hotels that have more amenities, with breakfast included in their price located within the old city. Many people will be tempted to stay here because the Sunday night market is just at their front door but once again do not let this persuade you to do so. We endured a night here and ended up in a nicer hotel that was only 5 minutes walk from the night market.",January 2017,Villa Duang Champa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293917-d668586-Reviews-Villa_Duang_Champa-Chiang_Mai.html,"Chiang Mai, Thailand",hotels,2.0,4.5
Reclining Buddha and more,"Reclining Buddha is gargantuan. After seeing it from the front (head to toe), do walk around to see its back. You will find 108 bowls along the right wall, where one can put coins in them. For 20 Baht, you get a bowl of coins & simply drop one into each of those bowls & you will walk to the end of the room. A stroll around the temple ground is pleasant and will entice you to take more photographs. From there we walked to the Amulet market (parts of it along the river).",January 2017,Wat Phra Chetuphon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293916-d311043-Reviews-Wat_Phra_Chetuphon-Bangkok.html,"Bangkok, Thailand",attractions,5.0,4.5

Architecture and Intrigue,Jim Thompson was an American who retired in Bangkok and revived the silk industry. This is an interesting place to visit. Go early.

Fine Thai dining experience,"Prices here are high but the quality is good. We made a reservation for 2 and were seated at a table that was nice and cozy downstairs. This is a Thai fine dining restaurant. We had the Taster's menu at 2,200 Baht each. There was a lot of food. Only complaint was that the shrimp was a little over cooked for our liking but the flavour was satisfying. Their crab curry (lump crab meat) and salmon laab were outstanding. The mango with sticky rice and coconut ice cream was a delighful finale.

Affordable and delicious Thai food,"Fried spring rolls were non greasy & good. Pad Thai was flavourful. You must try their apple pie for dessert. It gets busy during peak dining hours, so a reservation (especially for dinner) will guarantee a table. We went early or late and was seated without any reservation.

MISLEADING,"We did not get the room we reserved. Apparently our reserved room was already occupied. When we made the reservation to request for that particular room, we were told to go through Airbnb. Handling of this issue was very poorly done by Alexa, who lacked social skills and was uncongenial. We stayed the night because it took 90 minutes to get there and I was too tired to argue with her. Our room was VERY basic and had a hole (at least 2 inches in diameter) in the wood floor. I covered it with my suitcase but when I woke up the next morning, my suitcase was wet. Vehicle noise from the road could be heard from our room. We DO NOT RECOMMEND Chai Lai Orchid. Please do thorough research because there are at least 2 other places one can go to for the elephant experience. When we returned home we met a couple who went to another place and had a better experience than us.",January 2017,Chai Lai Orchid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g2237291-d3640765-Reviews-Chai_Lai_Orchid-Mae_Wang.html,"Mae Wang, Thailand",hotels,2.0,4.5
Good food with friendly service,"We dined here twice and the same lady who served us was very pleasant. She explained their menu to us and later told us about the Chiang Rai Flower Festival (which was nice too).
