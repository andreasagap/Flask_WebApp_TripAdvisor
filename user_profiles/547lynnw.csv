Hospitality at its best,"Our visit to Chilo Gorge Safari Lodge exceeded all our expectation. The hospitality was the very best, for the reception, to the restaurant and bar, and the guiding. We could not have wished for anything more.
The trip into the park was guided with expertise and with great awareness of our interests. The park looked fabulous after the rains, and we saw over 130 species of birds and some special mammal sightings.
The food was varied and excellent - eaten the most beautiful of settings.
Our room had a lovely view - and we heard leopard very nearby at night.

"Excellent, authentic local dishes","This bistro is excellent, offering a great menu of local dishes and more generic european dishes. Good, friendly service. The Cullen Skink was to die for - I really wanted just to have a second helping as a main, it was so good. The haggis, tatties and neeps was also delicious. The portions were large - too large for me but impressed my companions. Good wine list and craft beer. Would highly recommend.",July 2018,Black Sheep Bistro,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186534-d1906441-Reviews-Black_Sheep_Bistro-Glasgow_Scotland.html,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
