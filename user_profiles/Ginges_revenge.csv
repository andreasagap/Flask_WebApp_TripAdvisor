Old and looking a little run down.,"It used to really busy and vibrant ages ago, now it looks a little disheveled around the edges.
We thought we'd give it a go as we hadn't been there in years.
It was an average meal. Atmosphere was family orientated, but lacking in any real feeling. It was dim inside, at least they had some TV's showing AFL and NRL on.
Food came out quickly which was a relief as we could then leave.
Wont be going back any time soon.",March 2021,Greenhouse Tavern,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g255059-d4914362-Reviews-Greenhouse_Tavern-Coffs_Harbour_New_South_Wales.html,"Coffs Harbour, Australia",restaurants,3.0,3.5
"Excellent course, even though it was wet.","I played here as a junior over 35 years ago and this was the first time id been back for a round of golf. The layout was the same with some changes of lakes being put in. The course was wet due to the heavy weather, but it was great to get out to my early stomping grounds.
The course if dry, would be amazing. It is kept really well. Pricing was good.
The pro shop staff were really nice. the bar area upstairs is good and you can look over the finishing holes for the 18th and 27th.
If you want to play a round of golf, this is an excellent course. Just ensure that you ring up to check prior to going for a round, like most course.",March 2021,Coffs Harbour Golf Club,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g255059-d12921176-Reviews-Coffs_Harbour_Golf_Club-Coffs_Harbour_New_South_Wales.html,"Coffs Harbour, Australia",attractions,5.0,4.5
A good RSL.,"When visiting family, we normally go here for a meal and the meat raffles. Its a good RSL club.
The bistro area has heaps of seating, it has a good selection of foods and the service is quick.
Drinks and meals are reasonably priced.
Hospitality and service is friendly.
If you want a nice time out, this is the place in Sawtell.",March 2021,SAWTELL RSL CLUB,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g529020-d7651489-Reviews-SAWTELL_RSL_CLUB-Sawtell_New_South_Wales.html,"Sawtell, Australia",restaurants,4.0,4.0
7Eleven coffee is better,"If you want a decent cup of coffee, 7Eleven does a better cup. For $3 at the chain store, you can get a large skinny cappuccino that is hotter and more flavorsome and cheaper than what you get here.
There wasn't much atmosphere in the place either
The first try was just OK, so id thought id try it again when I went past, but what I got for the 2nd try was like warmed up dishwater. It was luke warm, and not very tasty.

Really lovely food.,"We have been here a couple of times and have always enjoyed it.
We were a walk up and were graciously slotted in for a table for two if we could order, eat and be out in 50 minutes as the place was booked out later on.
As we were only walking past and just went in on a whim, we accepted the challenge.
We both ordered a starter and a main.
the food came out quickly but still had a decent spacing between dishes.
The food was very tasty and spicy.
We got out in time for the next people to eat so everyone was a winner.
The pricing was pretty good as well.
I will definitely be going back.",February 2021,Kinn Thai,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1905476-d9581475-Reviews-Kinn_Thai-North_Lakes_Moreton_Bay_Region_Brisbane_Region_Queensland.html,"North Lakes, Australia",restaurants,4.0,4.0
"Great food, service not the best","It was pretty busy and we were a walk up with no reservation. There was a lot of confusion lining up to get in from outside. We finally got through the multiple Covid 19 sign ins and got a table right out the back, located on Grey St. There wasn't very much atmosphere.
You had to download the menu on your phone. The directions from the wait staff was vague and we thought we had to order the food online as well, which we didn't. We eventually got the waitress and ordered our food which was very nice.
They had a belly dancer which was pretty ordinary. It was hard to watch with a gentleman playing, im not sure what it was but it looked homemade and sounded like two cats fighting. I was happy when it ended and they left our area.
We tried to get the cheque 3 times as the waitress kept forgetting to come back. It nearly made us late for the theatre.
After recently spending time in Istanbul, it was a very different Turkish experience then what was expected.
Great food, questionable service and the atmosphere was different.",February 2021,Ahmet's Turkish Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g255068-d897249-Reviews-Ahmet_s_Turkish_Restaurant-Brisbane_Brisbane_Region_Queensland.html,"Brisbane, Australia",restaurants,4.0,4.0
An OK pub close to the beach.,"The Blue Pacific Hotel is just an OK pub close to the beach in the Woorim area. The pub is owned by the Woolworths corporation. For WW staff members there is half price meals, so this is why we went there for lunch.
It was ok, the meal was nice and came out quickly as there weren't to many people in the pub when we were there.
it has all the usual pub amenities, sports area, bar, bistro, keno and pokies.
If you are in the area, its worth a visit for a cheap meal or a drink after being at the beach.",February 2021,Blue Pacific Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g2369834-d7296197-Reviews-Blue_Pacific_Hotel-Woorim_Bribie_Island_Moreton_Bay_Region_Brisbane_Region_Queen.html,"Bribie Island, Australia",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Excellent pub.,"I have driven past it hundreds of times, always wanted to go to it, especially after going to a game at the GABBA. I have finally done it. It’s a great pub. It has the old section at the front which has all the history of the original pub and the back is all newly done. It has a restaurant section, beer garden section with a bistro and a really good outside seating section. Food from the bistro section at the pub was quick. Prices were good.

Rated best Courier Mail fish and chippery in Brissy in 2019? Not sure if it still keeps this in 2020 - 21?,"We went down on new years 2020 to have some fish and chips for lunch. It wasn't to bad for people waiting in line and the wait was about 20 minutes which wasn't to bad after the food was ordered.
We went across to the park to have lunch. When opening up the pack, I was a little disappointed. The piece of fish for $11 wasn't that big (not a fan of cod so normally have flake / snapper / red emperor etc if possible when having fish and chips). The calamari was big rubbery ring and the coating was flaking off and greasy. The chips however were OK.
All in all, a pretty standard fish and chippery that is a little overpriced in my mind for the quality that I think you get.
I'm going to have to try this again just to confirm my opinion.",December 2020,Yabbey Road,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g494999-d8630755-Reviews-Yabbey_Road-Redcliffe_Moreton_Bay_Region_Brisbane_Region_Queensland.html,"Redcliffe, Australia",restaurants,3.0,4.5
Good meals in the Spanish Garden.,"We like to eat in the Spanish Garden (restaurant side) of the Brekky Creek hotel. You can book online which we do.
When going in, you have to check in Covid wise using the QR-code which is standard in these times, pretty easy to do and you need to show the green tick prior to entering.
They have the menu for items but normally have specials as well which you can choose.
Its great to have a good steak cooked well. When choosing your steak, you can go and have a look in the fridge by the grill station and can even talk to the chef cooking the steaks to have a look at the cuts. The chefs are very good and will gladly show you what you have asked for. (I did this for when looking at the 700gm and 1.2kg tomahawk rib on the bones).
The steaks are cooked perfectly and melt in your mouth when they come out.
They can range in prices, be prepared to pay for a good steak though.
The service is very friendly and very organized.
The food is normally pretty quick depending on the size of the steak ordered.
The only issue encountered by myself the last time there was dirt glasses on the table when being seated. One still had lipstick on it and the rest were very grubby. This was cleared very quickly when the wait staff were notified. Other than that, it has always been good.
They are part of the Woolworths chain so you can use your staff discount card there if you have one. Check that the 1/2 price meals are still available for that.
All in all, its a good meal and very enjoyable setting.
After the meal, we went into the bar side and had a flutter on the cardies. Issue being that the smoking zone is in under the cover and the smoke enters this area which was really horrid, they need to put it outside.
great for a meal though in the Spanish garden.",December 2020,Breakfast Creek Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g255068-d811706-Reviews-Breakfast_Creek_Hotel-Brisbane_Brisbane_Region_Queensland.html,"Brisbane, Australia",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Great course and great value,"It was a bit of a trek going from the north side of Brisbane over to Windaroo but it was well worth the effort.
You had to check in through the Q-Code when booking in at the pro shop, very standard and easy.
The cost of the round was about $36 per person which was excellent. Its cheaper than a lot of courses in Brisbane and a lot better than most of them as well.
The course is well kept, the greens at the time of play were like carpet and very quick, very good greens. The fairways were well kept with a good 2nd cut leading into playable rough. There is a lot of water but its not daunting. The course is par 72. It is a great course and well worth it for the money.
The club house is very modern, comfortable and even has a coffee bar which was excellent.
All in all, its an excellent course at really impressive pricing. I thoroughly enjoyed it being a 15 handicapped player and will be going back.",December 2020,Windaroo Lakes Golf Course,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g8426670-d14957640-Reviews-Windaroo_Lakes_Golf_Course-Windaroo_Logan_City_Brisbane_Region_Queensland.html,"Windaroo, Australia",attractions,5.0,4.5

We got into what we thought was the train station but found out we had purchased the Metrolink tram tickets. The system was really good. Took a little while to get from the airport into the city center, but it was pretty good. We only used it to and from the airport as we were looking to get that flight out of Europe back down under.

We wanted a restaurant a short walk from our hotel and this fitted the bill perfectly when doing the TripAdvisor search.
We were here prior to the Covid spacing restrictions and face covering etc.
We were greeted by a cheery bar attendant who informed us where to head for the restaurant part of the pub.
We were again greeted by a friendly waiter who seated us and looked after us for our meal.
It wasn't that busy due to the Covid issue but there was some other customers in as well.
They had a good menu and a lot of drink options as they had a large gin collection for consumption which suited me fine.

The Travelodge check in was easy. the lady behind the counter was polite and professional and very helpful.
The room was very large. A little sparse in furnishings but was clean, tidy.
I have marked the rating down as the bed had two dips in it were people sleep. This makes it hard and a little uncomfortable when trying to sleep/ roll over etc and you keep rolling back into the dip. Other than that, it is in a good location, close to may amenities / shops / restaurants.

It shows Lord Byron in a very youthful look being crowned with a branch of palm.,March 2020,Statue of Lord Byron,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d13543453-Reviews-Statue_of_Lord_Byron-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.0
"Good location, not the best hotel.","We chose this place due to its location and its views and rooftop restaurant (where breakfast is served).
The rooms looked OK in the photos but the room we got was a little dirty and mouldy.
The room was large with 3 single beds. The fridge didn't work, there was a lot of dust on the floor and a lot of mould around the window frames. For a traveler, there was only one power point in there which was the one the TV was plugged into. Luckily we take a power board with us so we could charge all our devices.
Due to Covid restrictions, the roof top restaurant was closed so you couldn't get the great view up the Acropolis while eating breakfast, which was one of the reasons we chose this place this place.
Location was good, hotel other than that was a let down.",March 2020,Hotel Bryon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d253754-Reviews-Hotel_Bryon-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,2.0,3.0
Such a shame it was closed.,"This was one of the places I really wanted to see when I visited Athens. I had read so much about I and was really chomping at the bit to see it for myself. Due to Covid restrictions in Greece, it was closed, which was a shame. It just gives me the excuse to do another OS trip when everything opens back up again. This is still a must see.",March 2020,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
