Top class 5* star hotel and resort,"We did not stay overnight at this hotel but booked sunbeds by the pool for the day and therefore got to see the rooms from the outside, the hotel areas and outside areas.

Tastefully decorated both inside and out.

On arrival security at the entrance checked our reservation and TEMPERATURES before allowing us to proceed to reception.

We had booked 5 sunbeds and the reception staff promptly arranged for a 6 seater 'chariot/gold transport' to take us to the pool area outside and overlooking the sea with it's almost infinity pool.

Sunbeds had been spaced further apart for social distancing but there were still enough for everyone, ours allowed us to dip our toes in the water surrounding the large swimming pool.

There are 2 types of beds, individual ones that can be moved around to suit groups and the fixed position platforms with 2 bes on each raised platform, the beds were equipped with towels and ""fitted cover towels"" which were in sealed bags on the beds ready and waiting for the user.

Now the confusion started, we had phoned the night before to book sunbeds and were quoted 15 euros per bed from 10:1 to pm (ish) s 75 euros for the beds, when were allocated our beds we were quoted 200 euros but told that included food and drinks on an 'all inclusive' basis which seemed fair enough.

We had drinks consisting of 1 Bacradi and Coke, a number of Mythos Lagers for my partner, a number of soft drink and a few Alcohol Free cocktails, for a snack we had 5 portions/plates of vegetable Spring Rolls, 3 portions of cheese cake and a chocolate fudge cake.

When we left the bill was 314 euros, so my confusion is firstly why we had to go all inclusive instead of the option we had booked and why the 200 euro all inclusive package turned into 314 euros, I am sure there is a valid explanation but before we return in the future I would like to know the exact price options and exactly what is and isn't included, 2 of the friends we went with live in Hersonnisos nearby so would like to return quite often.

The staff were attentive and extremely polite though drinks did take quite a long time to arrive after ordering with at least 2 orders being forgotten altogether and having to re-order more than once on each occasion.

The pool is amazing, the grounds beautiful and the rest of the hotel immaculately clean. the rooms with the small 'plunge' style pool looked very nice and inviting with an area for sitting/sunbathing outside on the sun loungers.

There was a DJ operating in the bar/dining area by the pool and he played some cool sounds but not so loud that anyone might find it too much.

There was a second kitchen area by the sunbeds and perhaps this is where the confusion started, this kitchen seemed to be more about preparing food to be delivered by the waiting staff, perhaps we were supposed to order from that kitchen but this was not explained to us and we were only told that food and drinks were all inclusive and that we could download the menu to our phones as under Covid regulations the menus had been removed.

We WILL return for more days in the sun and the pool but please explain the pricing structures to us.",August 2020,Abaton Island Resort & Spa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g503710-d12921531-Reviews-Abaton_Island_Resort_Spa-Hersonissos_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5
Not sure why it is called Spinalong beach,"Spinalonga itself is lovely and steeped in history but as for a beach, perhaps not, a selection of rocky areas, large rocks where treading carefully you can negotiate your way into some small areas for bathing, not the kind of place you can sunbathe at all really, no sand, lot's of rocks and hundreds of people getting on and off the tour boats from nearby villages and towns.",August 2020,Spinalonga Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189416-d12854686-Reviews-Spinalonga_Beach-Elounda_Lasithi_Prefecture_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",attractions,3.0,4.5
Another pleasant visit,"5th visit to this Island and former leper colony though it should be remembered for much more than just the colony, a former fortress that protected the approaches to Plaka, Elounda and Agios Nikoliaos. we always find something new to look at when we take friends there as we do every year.

The history is interesting not least for it's role in exporting to places as far as The Ottoman Empire and Russia.

Best access if you have a car is from Plaka where the boats to the island are frequent allowing you to visit for a short trip or longer meander around the ruins, it is a bit of a hike so be prepared for that and only wheelchair accessible in certain areas if you have a strong person to assist you around.

There is a small but nice café on the island for snacks and drinks as well as souvenirs and many more shops/restaurants in Plaka or indeed all the villages and towns where you can start tours to the Island",August 2020,Spinalonga (Kalydon),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189416-d547593-Reviews-Spinalonga_Kalydon-Elounda_Lasithi_Prefecture_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",attractions,3.0,4.5
Love this little Restaurant,"Located in the main harbour square of Elounda amongst many other restaurants, we stopped to view the menu for lunch a warm welcome and full explanation of the menu and what was available we decided to check out the other restaurants before making our decision, the owner wished us well without a hint of pushing us to eat at his restaurant.

After checking out the rivals we returned and of course were welcomed back, we ordered drinks and meals, Moussaka for our friend, Lamb Shank for my partner Sasha and Fish and Chips for me, we all thoroughly enjoyed our meals, they were delicious but we managed to find room for sweets, Baklava for Sarah and a chocolate fondant for me exceptional on all accounts.

We will return to this restaurant in future as we always enjoy our visits here.",August 2020,Babel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189416-d3184147-Reviews-Babel-Elounda_Lasithi_Prefecture_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Good service good food excellent views,"Returned to this restaurant after a year while taking a friend to visit Spinalonga Island (the former Leper Colony).

Just drinks today but loved feeding the fish while sat drinking you look into the crystal clear waters of the Aegean sea just below your table and see nothing but smooth rocks, then the waiter comes along and throws a little bread over, the waters immediately team with fish, not sure what breed but they look like large sardines, the bread bobs and moves around the water as thousands of fish vie for a nibble of each piece which is very entertaining to watch.

A guitarist played some nice background music while we drank and diners ate, non-obtrusive sitting away from the tables and after a while passes his hat round for a few euros of change, a pleasant experience and we loved his rendition of American Pie amongst other songs he played.

Drinks are reasonably priced for the area with a wide choice on the menu.

The staff are lovely and remembered us from visits over previous years, a knack the restaurant staff of Crete seem to have an amazing knack for doing.

Highly recommend this Tavern for both food and drinks but also for some of the best views of the Island.",August 2020,Taverna Spinalonga,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g6754342-d4604376-Reviews-Taverna_Spinalonga-Plaka_Elounda_Lasithi_Prefecture_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
a good flight apart from some idiots on board,"Our second flight with Easy Jet this year and both were good experiences with regard to the airline, the first was pre-Covid situation in Febraury to Athens but interesting to see how things were in the current situation.

The only notable difference pre-flight was the wearing of masks in the airport and on the aircraft, staff, check-in pre-flight information etc went as smoothly despiste a couple of hitches on the website mostly in trying to book the 'hands free' cabin bag option, we finally managed to do this 2 days before we flew and did get confirmation that we had booked 5 large hold suitcases and one cabin bag into the hold we wanted a 2nd cabin bag in the hold but online it saide we had reached the maximum of 6 bags.

At the airport the check-in machine said we had not paid for the first cabin bag to go into the hold so we ended up paying at the desk for 2 bags to go into the hold over and above the 5 large hold bags and one cabin bag we had paid for, I will deal with that on my return not worth messing about over a cost of £14 and delaying our boarding.

We pre-booked seats at the rear of the plane which on the seat options map of the aircraft showed this as being a 2 seater row but on boarding we found it was a standard 3 seat row, this seemed ok until after we should have departed as the last seat on each side of the aisle remained empty, but then a stewardess came and checked my partners passport then radioed someone to say ""No she is not on the aircraft"", a little later two late, late passengers turned up and occupied those seats.

We first encountered those late passengers in the smoking room at Manchester Airport, we left when we heard the tannoy announcement to say that our flight was boarding, however the loud male of the other couple said ""F em"" I am going for more drinks they can wait - and wait we did, they were very late boarding then boasted all the way to Crete about being called 5 times to come to the departure gate but carried on drinking, they continued to drink throughout flight to our surprise because the female of the two was telling everyone how she was pregnant, so smoking and drinking excessively, to make it worse apart from their loudness they refused to wear their masks with the same ""F em"" to requests by the cabin crew to put them on and kept going in to the toilets returning to boast to each other they had enjoyed their cigarettes. My partner suffers from extreme Asthma and we found their refusal to abide by the rules very disconcerting and felt that the cabin crew should have done more to protect US and other passengers.

For all of that though the flight did make up the time and we arrived in Heraklion on time and at least know they have now returned to the UK (having stayed less time than us because their first born had, had his first birthday the day before they left the UK (without him)) so won't have to suffer them on our return flight.

Bustling main street and beach area,"A very good main street bustling with people at the many bars, restaurants, cafés and shops, everything you need in one street.

Great Location Great Food,"We went here on the recommendation of Dimitra, a girl we love and trust that has shown us some great places to visit in Crete over the last 6 years, this is her first season at Danomeas but if they are wise it won't be her last, in herself she is an attraction because she knows so many of the repeat tourist who come to the Island every year and have learned to trust her when she recommends a place or a restaurant and equally so when she tells you where to avoid.

We went there with her sister Ersi and her Mother, her family have become great friends since we met them 5 years ago in Crete and we even went to Paris with Ersi and Dimitra in February.

As for the Restaurant, not the easiest to find albeit located on the main tourist road through Stalis, the small entrance belies a large restaurant that stretches right back onto the beach where they have a small children's play area and sunbeds so you can have snacks or drinks while sunbathing or enjoying the excellent views of the Sea.

On our first visit I chose the Wiener Schnitzel but the four of us chose different meals each of us thoroughly enjoying our particular choice and especially the Garlic Bread Entrée.

Prices were very reasonable to the extent we returned 2 days later and both enjoyed a superb Steak each, cooked to our personal taste and to perfection, I have no doubt we will be returning again before our holiday ends.

All the Staff are friendly and efficient making sure we enjoyed our food and that everything was to our satisfaction.

The menu is varied with English/American dishes and traditional Greek dishes as well as dishes from other Nations such as Germany and Italy.

Our waiter pointed out that they had been unable to procure a suitable fresh fish order that day because the fishing had been poor due to the extreme heat, his honestly was refreshing in telling us that the Red Snapper would be from a frozen choice as opposed to the usual absolute fresh not frozen choice.",July 2020,Dianomeas,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g644210-d1545693-Reviews-Dianomeas-Stalis_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
"Amazing FOOD, Amazing SERVICE, Amazing VIEWS","Certainly one of the areas hidden gems, not the easiest to find by accident but worth seeking out because the food is the best we have tasted on our 5 trips to Crete over the years,

Beautiful views of the sea, loads of outdoor seating and amazing food full of flavour, everything freshly prepared and served with a super smile by the owners wife.

As an added bonus you must try the Cretan wines that are home made in the families vineyard along with the home made honey and Olive Oil which is available to buy inside the restaurant.

The Chef has almost 30 years of experience we are told and it shows, all our meals for our party of 6 were superb absolutely superb.

It is hard to choose the best dish amongst our choices which ranged from chicken fillets, Pork chops in a mushroom sauce, salads, garlic bread (absolutely delicious and fresh) and more.

Generous sized portions at very reasonable prices this was our first visit but certainly will not be our last and we will add this lovely restaurant to our weekly 'to do' list when visiting Crete as we love to do each year.

We were welcomed by not only the owner and his wife but the very accomplished chef and tended to very well throughout our visit. Everything we ate was tender, flavoursome, piping hot and delicious.

We entered as customers and felt we left as friends.

5th time at this wonderful hotel,"I have published a number of reviews on the hotel it's location and facilities over the last 5 years so will not repeat myself too much but suffice to say we will not stay anywhere else when we visit Crete, the fact that it is a family run hotel is still very apparent and the warmth of welcome still the priority here, quite a large number of the guests are here for their first visit having had to re-think plans for holidays in Spain and have already re-booked for next year as of course have we.

George even managed to keep our annual plans for Sasha's birthday party, a large affair that was a Greek Toga party this year and as you will see from the photos well attended by many hotel guests and friends we have made on Crete in previous years, George organises the cake, the fireworks but we made a joint decision to cancel the live entertainment this year to avoid group dancing and breaching social distancing rules, the large table in the photos are occupied by a group of 15 guests who form part of a wonderfull family of 4 related families so are allowed less social distancing.

As always we had an incredible nights fun and made many new friends who we look forward to seeing next year at the Arabian Nights themed party.

Always worth a visit,"Plaka beach is a small pretty beach set at the far end of the village if your travelling up the coast road from Agia Nikolas which is the popular route through places like Elounda,

Made from large smooth stones it has a car park to it's rear and you can hire sunbeds of the basic type but also the large twin bedded four poster style complete with two single mattresses and with towels supplied that come encased in individual polythene bags at the start of your bed hire (please be careful to dispose of those responsibly) the beds are cleaned after each persons use and I believe cost 2 euros for the basic hire per day and 10 euros for the 'VIP' beds.

The water is crystal clear with excellent views of the former leper colony that is Spinalonga.

Nearby there are shops and a small jetty where you can cheaply be taken to the island with trips leaving every half hour or so,

There are a number of cafés and restaurants adjacent to the beach and the beach has a small number of cabins where you can change in private for free there is also a shower to rinse off after your swimming.

Usually you will find jet skis for hire although on this occasion we did not see any available; a little further down and just outside the village there are small motor boats for hire not powerful but with curtains to allow you some shelter from the sunshine.",August 2020,Plaka Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g6754342-d8639886-Reviews-Plaka_Beach-Plaka_Elounda_Lasithi_Prefecture_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.0
Great restaurant Great views,"Not our first visit to this restaurant not our last but this time we went with Cretan friends who are probably better judges of local cuisine especially since their Father is a Chef at a local restaurant in Hersonissos.

We all enjoyed the food and service with strict Covid rules in place for the staff but being outside not applicable to the customers.

The views of Spinalonga Island are second to none across the short stretch of water from the mainland village of Plaka.

Prices might be considered higher but only higher than other parts of the Island and on a par with all the restaurants along the stretch of coastline from Ayia Nikolas through Elounda up to Plaka,

It is a very small beach area normally visited by many of the local tour boats but in the current climate was very quiet.

FROM BAD TO WORSE,"Following the fiasco of last month with Jet2 deliberately delaying the cancellation of our holiday until after the balance was due despite Jet2 announcing they would not by flying in June, the UK Foreign Office advising us NOT to travel in June and the Greek Government stopping flights to Crete during June did have another flight booked with them paid for in full.

Today I got an email from them saying that our flights would not now be taking place, ie cancelled and that they would refund my payment in full within 28 days.

We are not a huge $Billion dollar profit making company, we do not have funds in our bank for such a rainy day as to be able to wait for a refund when Consumer Law states refund must be made within 14 days, NO Company can enforce terms and conditions which break Consumer Law.

Other airlines are offering flights on the dates we were due to fly with Jet2 but we cannot book them unless we are given a refund within the time scale Consumer Law stipulates.

Many Companies are saying longer refund times than Consumer Law dictates but are also warning that refunds could take up to 6 months.

Not only would I lose out to being able to travel on the dates I want but I have also paid for the hotel and over £1000 on events that we had planned to happen during our holiday (I have receipts for these events) but no refund is being offered for those financial losses.

Jet2 have closed their helplines, furloughed the staff that would man those helplines and send emails to me with no option to reply (unmonitored email addresses).

Their conduct is immoral and no way to treat people who were in the past loyal customers and tried to work with them to change dates for travel but found it impossible to do so because they cannot be contacted.",July 2019,Jet2.com,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8729098-Reviews-Jet2com,World,flights,1.0,4.5
Great park great facilities,"Our favourite park in Stoke on Trent, always quite popular and busy a little moreso during lockdown when places to ""get outdoors"" are a little harder to get to, in glorious sunshine today was no exception but nonetheless we found social distancing easy to uphold. This park is excellent with beaufiful walks through nature on well organised pathways.

A gorgeous lake with cute wildlife is the central focus point but the park offers much more to make for a pleasant few hours break from the restrictions of lockdown.

Although there is a skate park and childrens playground we found this park to be more about Nature and wildlife which without young children we found was an added factor to our own visit the woods and lake, the pathways and grassed areas are superb, perfect for a picnic and people seem to follow the common courtesy rule of taking away their own rubbish sadly missed in some parks.

Good sized park easy access,"Not one of the largest park in the area but a good place to visit to ease lockdown blues, it has everything you would expect from such an attraction with something for everyone, we only spent an hour here but were very pleased with what we found even under lockdown conditions with some parts of the park closed it is also well located for other attractions in the area and easily accessible via the A500/A53, walking distance of the City Centre (Hanley) and the large retail park (Etruia), restaurants and more (sadly many closed at the moment).

We enjoyed the scenary and the walking areas, and will return when all the faciities are re-opened whenever that may be, but for now it did make a pleasant day out in glorious sunshine and a well earned break from being stuck at home during lockdown with ample space for social distancing.

Nearby attractions include the dry ski slopes, Industrial museum, canal and small lake but of course check opening restrictions until lockdown is over.",June 2020,Etruria Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186378-d13975144-Reviews-Etruria_Park-Stoke_on_Trent_Staffordshire_England.html,"Stoke-on-Trent, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.5
Excellent mid-size park,"A short drive to Newcastle and Lyme Valley Park, with few options of places to go during lockdown, we found this to be a nice little park to spend a couple of hours.

There are larger parks in the area and some we have already visited but LVP does exactly what it says on the tin, a restful place for a walk with dog walking permitted (using the obvious dog poo bags of course).

a number of pathways and good parking facilities (a few more parking controls under current COVID 19 regulations) the park normally has live attractions throughout the year but of course not at the moment it does however have some good play areas including those for skate boarding, cycling, football and basketball, often visited by Ice Cream vendors it makes for a great day out for families and pet owners alike.

Shown their true colours now,"We have flown with Jet2 many, many times and they were our preferred budget airline for many years, but I guess it is when things are difficult and things go wrong that you get to see the true Company at work.

We paid deposits for our trip to Crete on 18th June 2020, of course we expected to have those fights cancelled due to the COVID 19 situation and it soon became very clear that this would be the case when the UK Foreign Office announced both travel restrictions and their recommendation not to fly unless the journey was absolutely necessary, then the Greek Government announced that no tourist flights would be allowed to take place till after June.

We did not panic, we waited for Jet2 to contact us nearer to the flight time to cancel the holiday, we waited and we waited right up to the point when Jet2 started demanding the balance of payment for our holiday would had no way of taking place.

We then tried to telephone Jet2 to re-arrange the dates of our travel only to find they had turned off their phone lines, we contacted them via their facebook page to be told only that we had to abide by the terms of contract. A contract that Jet2 knew they were unable to abide by and that under the Consumer laws of the UK would entail them cancelling our holiday and refunding all payments made, the did not cancel the holiday and continued trying to get the balance payment from my bank account.

They waited until the balance payment was overdue then wrote to me by email saying they would refund my payments but no payment was forthcoming during the legal timeline for repayments to be made.

I cancelled my credit card payment and had the amount re-credited to my account, Jet2 are now disputing this claim insisting that it was my fault for not complying with the terms of contract. A claim which I will take to the small claims court if necessary, Jet2 knew they would have to cancel the holiday, they simply delayed cancelling it until they could keep what I had paid, morally reprehensible and abuse of UK Consumer laws.

I understand that like many businesses Jet2 are under great pressure at this time however so am I and many other consumers with (for us) no income and not being a multi National Company who make great profits, no 'rainy day' savings to fall back on, I would have been happy to change my dates if given the opportunity but financially unable to commit further funds to the booking until the necessary time prior to actually travelling, by closing down their telephone lines I was unable to do this in a satisfactory manner.

Their actions have alienated a loyal customer and will possibly lead to them appearing in the small claims court on principle more than a desire to get my money back, for the sake of £240 deposit they have driven away this customer and probably more.

At a time when many businesses have stepped up and shown excellent customer service and customer care they have shown themselves to be only interested in getting as much out of existing customers as they can with no thought for what is right, what is wrong or even what is Legal.",June 2020,Jet2.com,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8729098-Reviews-Jet2com,World,flights,1.0,4.5
DAMAGED LUGGAGE ACTION REVIEW,"I reviewed Flybe last month and though the Company is no longer operating I thought an addition to my review may help others, my last review pointed out that my suitcase had been destroyed on the flight, one wheel hanging off, one wheel gone completely and a large split about 9 inches long in the hard thick plastic.

Well on my return I contacted Flybe about the luggage and they immediately put me in touch with the Company that deal with such problems/complaints and are responsible for luggage at most airports.

They arranged to send me a brand new and quality suitcase within 4 days and indeed the new case did arrive in 3 days and after Flybe had gone into liquidation so at least even in death the Company took care of at least one aspect of my journey",February 2020,Flybe [no longer operating],https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8728910-Reviews-Flybe-No-Longer-Operating,World,flights,5.0,3.5

The Best,"Personally I think this is one of the best Ski resorts in Europe, Swiss efficiency to make it a wonderful experience for any size group, any age and any level of ability on skis or boards or even sledges.

the Classical Music Festival which attracts people from all over the world and goes on for around a fortnight, the Beach Volleyball yes a beach volley ball competition 5000ft up in the alps, not surprising with Swatch being one of the largest sponsors of Beach Volleyball around the world the village use the trucks that are employed in the Winter months to transport snow out of the village to bring in a sand and turn one of the larger car parks into a beach that would not look out of place in Australia, top teams, and a spectacle for everyone not just beach volleyball fans, the Mountain Biking is huge, great runs and as soon as the ski season ends the ski racks are removed from the ski lifts and replaced with bike racks, routes marked and the organisation swung into place, where else can you be transported up a 10,000 feet mountain to cycle down ?

In nearby Martigny the ancient Roman arena is the place to go for Christmas Market style extravaganza with chariot and Gladiator displays, stalls and entertainers.

Probably the most popular Cheval restaurant in Verbier,"Excellent food, excellent staff, lovely ambience/building well located on the walk up to the main Ski Lifts so very busy in the Apres ski times and throughout the evenings.

Cheval of course is French for Horse and they do specialise in dishes made from horsemeat but also have other meat choices, horsemeat tends to look (uncooked) more like liver, less grainy than the likes of Beef or lamb so easy to spot.

Apre Ski at it's best,"It should be rubbish, just a bar, it's not, it is amazing with what everyone of all ages want after a morning on the slopes, everyone from staff to customers are super friendly, the management are super friendly, the food is good and reasonably priced. A large bar that would still get cramped if it was 5 times as big.

The trek up the hill is well worth it and at the end of the night a bit easier downhill, unless of course, like us, you live 100yds further up the hill but that never stopped us going and go we did, almost every night of our short 18 month working holiday in the village.

Occasionally some live entertainment and we have to say we loved the Twister game though never understand why the women's team always won, since the losers also lost items of clothing (to a modest level.

Loved it when the bell rang and the staff dolled out the free shots.

Amazing atmosphere with people of all Nationalities mixing and making friends like languages were all one.

Obviously a cloak room with attendant for coats and lot's of Ski/Snowboard racks, outside tables for the brave.

One of the best of the Paris Bridges,"OK so it is pretty clear that I like bridges, not particularly into the architecture or even the history that much but I know a nice bridge when I see one and it is the bridges that often lead to some of the best of the other attractions..

This one named after the Tsar Alexander is one of the prettiest bridges over the River Seine and located at the bottom end of the Champ Elysees area so a bridge you may well stumble across when you travelling around the main Paris Landmarks.

Turn to the left before you cross the bridge and you can wander along the banks of the river to the Louvre or cross the bridge turn to the right and head off following the embankment to the Eifel Tower with many other sites along the way in both directions.

The bridge itself is very ornate and well lit up at night especially if your taking one of the many evening cruises along the Seine.

It has ornate lighting spanning the bridge and a number of gold painted statues along it's sides with a beautiful centre piece.

Worth a visit because of that and because it is so close and an access point to many other place of interest,

Close to the Place de la Concorde and serviced by the Concord Metro station.",February 2020,Pont Alexandre III,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187147-d265614-Reviews-Pont_Alexandre_III-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,"Paris, France",attractions,5.0,4.5
Another European City another river but worth seeing,"Like most iconic cities of Europe Paris is Paris because of the river, the Danube, the Thames, the Seine, the Rhine and others all helped make the Cities that stand on them what they are and instigated the expansion of those Cities.

The Bridges on these river are often spectacular and the Seine is no different with many beautiful and iconic bridges and attractions along it's banks.

Many tour boats operate along it's length with daytime or evening cruises available some with live entertainment others allowing a view of the landmarks by night many well worth taking.

Highly recommend a visit even if it is only to see some of the bridges or meander along it's shoreline while you visit some of the landmarks and attractions, if your visiting Paris you will probably want to visit some of them such as the Lourve or the Eifel Tower anyway so take some time out to look at the river and it's bridges.",February 2020,Seine River,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187147-d189683-Reviews-Seine_River-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,"Paris, France",attractions,5.0,4.5
Brilliant photo op,"No it's not the USA, not as big as the original and not as iconic, one of many copies of the iconic New York version but still worth a visit, a short walk along the river seine from the Eifel Tower it is a great place for those important selfies,

A perfect but smaller replica you can surprise your facebook friends and make them wonder where you are and your probably going to be nearby at some point if your visiting Paris because there are many points along the walk that you will be drawn to such as the Eifel Tower or the Trocadero, so if the weather is pleasant enjoy the walk and the sights along the way.

Must see,"The most striking point of this bridge (a 1966 replacement for an earlier bridge) is the views it has of the Statue of Liberty one of a number of copies of the iconic American statue.

Easily accessible a short walk from the Eifel tower the bridge itself is not as spectacular as many of the other bridges on the River Seine but because of it's location in relation to the tower and the Statue of Liberty (Paris copy) well worth a visit.

McDonalds by another name,"The title is not meant in any way as a derogatory statement, fast food, McDonalds, KFC, Burger King and Quick all have their place.

We stayed very close to the Champs Elysees and had two young women with us who just happen to love fast food, (though don't ask me why since they live in Hersonissos, Crete where good food cafés and restaurants abound) but being with fast food, clothes loving women we found ourselves on the Champs Elysees for a short time every day.

Ordering from the auto point we found the menu a bit more varied than Maccy dees and the food no better nor worse.

Just another maccy dees,"Have to admit I am not a great fan of McDonalds but it is a great place for a quickish snack, I doubt it can really be classed as a 'Fast Food establishment' anymore.

The one on the Champs Elysees occupies an ideal position from the Company's point of view just a 100 mtrs from the Arc de Triomphe it is extremely busy, but a large restaurant with an upstairs seating area which means I was coping even at lunchtime.

The food was no different to any other McDonalds I have ever visited and well priced compared with any place to eat near a Paris landmark/tourist attraction, we saw coffee on sale near the Eifel Tower at 16 euros per cup, were charge 22 euros for a cup of tea, small beer and small bottle of water more than half a mile from the tower so that in itself is a major point.

Ordering is almost totally be card/automatic ordering machine which I personally find a little difficult to understand but would be child's play to most regular uses and there does seem to be ample machines within the takeaway/café, I can't bring myself to call it a restaurant.

I found my fillet of fish and fries as always never seem to fill me up and I am by no means a big eater.

There is a nice covered area on the pavement outside which must be nice to use in the summer and ok even in February.

It is what it it and what it claims to be, nothing better nothing worse, great for McDonalds fans and there are millions of them the friends with us love them and were actively looking for one.",February 2020,McDonald's,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187147-d1080856-Reviews-McDonald_s-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,"Paris, France",restaurants,3.0,3.0

A local treasure that we don't visit as much as we should and would like to.

Excellent,"Over the years of sightseeing we have enjoyed we have discovered that the hop on hop off buses are always an integral part of our journeys.

We always get to see sites we would not have discovered or seen had we not used the buses, they vary in quality in terms of reliability, price, audio guides and so on but all worth using.

Athens is no exception and we used two different buses/routes to be sure of not missing anything and glad that we did, there were certainly places we went to that we would have missed out on without them.

For the most part they were very punctual and the bus stops easy to locate.

We recommend both routes and would do it again when we visit Athens we were travelling with 2 friends who had come over to join us on the overnight ferry from Crete so had our own translator with us but it was also our friends first visit to Athens so we learnt together and all enjoyed the experience.

A working port not a pretty port,"This is an extremely busy Port and very important I would imagine to Athens and Greece itself, providing access to and from many of the Greek Islands we were there to meet friends who were travelling overnight on the ferry from Heraklion in Crete.

Easy to navigate we took a pre-booked taxi from our nearby hotel from where we could see the hundreds of ferries arriving.

The taxi was not only able to enter the port but take us right to the berth where the ship was due to dock and wait with us for an hour (at no extra cost) for our friends to disembark and return with us to our hotel.

It was 5:30am when we arrived for the 6am docking but our driver directed us to the nearby café where we were able to purchase hot drinks and snacks while we waited for their arrival.

Athens visit without the Acropolis unthinkable,"Well if you have a passion for architecture or history you know you have to visit this site but you don't have to have those passions to visit the Acropolis, indeed travelling to Athens without visiting it seems a bit of a waste of holiday travel.

One of the most iconic buildings/sites in the World standing resplendent on a rocky outcrop in the centre of Athens it can be viewed for miles around, but get closer, walk in the steps of history.

The Acropolis is actually the rocky hill that dominates Athens on which stands the Parthenon or Temple of the Goddess of Athena, to say it is steeped in history is an understatement, completed in 438 BC.

The whole area is riddled with history and places of interest such as the Acropolis Museum the area is a 'Must See' attraction for all ages.

It IS a must-see though especially if you have either a lot of money to spend or enjoy window shopping.

Topped off with the equally famous Arc de Triomphe from the top of which you get amazing views down the Champs Elysee and all other directions of the City.

Beware the scammers and pickpockets of course but be more aware of those on the metro and buses, the Tourist attractions are well policed and the crooks well known so many have moved their operations away from these areas (though some still remain and new ones try their luck). The scammers still try their luck selling cheap tack or the old ""dropping a gold looking ring on the floor and trying to get a reward for giving it back to you, the greedy and gullible will always take it pretending they did drop it, or giving you a souvenir like a string bracelet insisting it is free then after a little small talk asking for little something for their kids, they will soon take the free gift back if you choose not to tip them.

Good stay nice hotel well located,"Surprised at some of the of these reviews, I booked two rooms for 4 nights and found the hotel to be very good value for money (based on Paris prices.

Warm welcome on arrival and my only complaint was the advance information that I feel we should have received before we got there, firstly the swimming pool, I telephoned the hotel 3 weeks before our arrival to see if the swimming pool would be open and was told that it was being re-furbished but that they expected it to be ready by the 18th which was our day of arrival, I telephoned again on the 15th with the same question but was told it should be ready for the 21st however on arrival we were told it would be open around the 26th, after our stay, secondly I requested that our rooms should be located close to each other but we were actually allocated one room on the Second floor and one on the Fifth floor meaning it would be difficult for them to be further apart, I understand such a request can be difficult but having been told this would be no problem I felt disappointed, finally we were not informed that the hotel itself is under renovation internally and the corridor outside our room was having a major re-paint, thankfully the paint smells did not penetrate into the room but were very strong in the corridor and the painters did make the necessary noise each morning to o their work, I think they were respectful that the hotel had guests but some noise was inevitable.

Apart from those things I found the rooms clean with very attentive Housekeeping staff and helpful reception staff.

The location is very good with a short 100 mtr walk to the nearest bus stop (the 92 takes you to within 300 mtrs of the Eifel Tower and River Seine at a spot where most of the river cruise ships dock, the fare is just 2euros per person.

The Arc de Triomphe is just a half mile or less walk from the hotel, and there are many bars, cafés, restaurants and other shops nearby.

The room has a hair dryer, kettle, tea/coffee, fridge and was warm in the cold February month, the balcony we paid for with one of the rooms was sufficient as we are smokers and were able to avoid going downstairs every time we wanted to smoke, the other room we booked for our friends was the same but without the balcony as they are non-smokers and cost slightly less.

The bathroom in both rooms was very nice with bath and overhead shower. the rooms are not overlarge but totally adequate and the flat screen TV had a variety of channels including some English channels such as Sky News and Film 4.

Apart from the aforementioned work noise the hotel is very quiet especially in the evenings and we were not disturbed by outside noise or by other guests even though our rooms were both adjacent to the lift.

We would certainly stay here again if in Paris, every hotel can have a problem and those I have mentioned did not totally spoil our stay.",February 2020,Hotel Westside Arc de Triomphe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187147-d197503-Reviews-Hotel_Westside_Arc_de_Triomphe-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,"Paris, France",hotels,4.0,4.0
Never fails to impress,"Personally I have seen the show many times, I keep returning to take friends and they are always incredibly impressed saying this is the best part of our visit to Paris.

I pre-purchased tickets online for the 4 of us at around 83 euros per person, basic tickets without meals or drinks and we chose the 9pm show.

A 2 minute queue on arrival and 5 minute queue inside to be shown our seats, we were sat adjacent to the stage so close that the feathers on the dancers outfits often brushed my head which was not a problem, certainly unrestricted views.

The dancers as always were a treat, the costumes an amazing spectacle the supporting acts of the strongmen, roller dancers and contortionist really amazing.

The ponies on the stage and boa constrictors in the pool are always great to watch.

The staff at the Moulin Rouge are ALL lovely from the coat storage to the waiters, the entrance staff and everyone else you encounter are friendly, super efficient and welcoming.

been before went again,"We took some friends to visit Paris so this as it is for many visitors was high on our list of places to see, we stayed just half a mile from the monument so took a leisurely walk up to it.

Always fascinated to watch the vehicles as they negotiate the roundabout surrounding the attraction, it really is worth watching and especially from the top of the monument giving a birds eye view of the organised chaos.

The monument itself houses a lot of history and can be enjoyed simply by taking a look around the base but you do have the option (well worth the hike) to go to the top and look down along the Champs Elysee.

The charge to go to the top is 11euros per person but EU citizens under 25 (and over 18) enter FREE on production of a photo ID.

Another interesting trip,"This was our second visit to the Tower but this time we took 2 friends with us who had never been to Paris before, a lot has changed in the area with the need for heightened security in this day and age.

Gone are the open walks through the adjacent parks that we enjoyed so much, the tower is now surrounded by fences and restricted areas but the tower itself is as it will always be.

We pre-purchased tickets for the summit online and found it took only 5 minutes or so to get to the lifts at the base of the tower, as always quite a wait to board the lifts but the tower can always only cater for so many visitors at a time, we stopped at each stage of the journey visiting the souvenir shop and had a bite to eat at the café.

At the summit there was plenty of room to wander round and take in the views as always.",February 2020,Eiffel Tower,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187147-d188151-Reviews-Eiffel_Tower-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,"Paris, France",attractions,5.0,4.5
Service above and beyond,"I booked flights for my friends and flights for myself and partner, I booked the flights at different times a month apart but was still able to book on the same flight and with seats adjacent to each other.

It was all very difficult to co-ordinate because my friends are one Greek and one Albanian both living in Crete so had to come to Athens by overnight ferry, then I had to get myself (British) and my partner (Lithuanian) to Athens from Manchester England in time to meet them off the ferry, get to the airport and travel. We flew out with Easyjet which went smoothly.

At the airport we had our boarding passed on my phone and those for my friends, Air France staff were extremely helpful in advising us and getting us to the check in desk with what we needed, then my Albanian friend was told she could not board the aircraft because she was not an EU Citizen, I explained that under new rules France accepted visitors with non-EU passports and that I had spoken to the French Embassy in London to confirm she could enter France, it took around 20 minutes but Air France staff were willing to make enquiries and investigate the situation rather than just refuse to assist, they completed their enquiries and my friend was allowed to board the aircraft having no problems entering France at the French Customs in Paris.

The situation could have been so much worse for us had Air France not been willing to help and look into the situation for us and for that we are eternally grateful.

The actual flight was good with reasonable seating, boarding arrangements food included in the ticket price an attentive cabin crew.

I would not hesitate to use Air France again.",February 2020,Air France,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8729003-Reviews-Air-France,World,flights,5.0,3.5
Once again excellent for a budget airine,"Flew out to Athens to meet with friends then for all of us to fly to Paris with another airline. As a budget airline I would rank them leaps and bounds above the likes of Ryanair who I used to use often but never use anymore having found that they are quite often dearer than their rivals with all the add-ons for luggage, cabin bags, food and drink prices, priority boarding and the fact that they often use airports much further from the mainline city centre airports (for example Berlin Schönefeld not Berlin Tegal) so the after flight transfer costs can be higher.

Easyjet is certainly no frills but still a very reasonable level of service and better than some other budgjet airlines.

The flight went without a hitch or drama and the staff were all excellent from check in to cabin crew",February 2020,easyJet,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8729066-Reviews-EasyJet,World,flights,5.0,3.5
£50 charge for one hold bag see the pictures,"Flybe charged me today 50 euros to add one hold bag onto the aircraft for an hours flight from Paris to Manchester, below you will see what they managed to do to my suitcase in that hour, I have tried contacting Flybe but could not do so at the airport because I had a taxi waiting which I had pre-paid for and had he left without me it would have cost me a further £70 to get home, I contacted them by phone as soon as I arrived home, they are closed until Monday, I tried contacting them by email but need a special number they would have issued at the airport apparently.

I have taken these photographs for when I am able to contact them.

Flight wise everything was fine, no better an no worse than any other budget airline, seats were on a par with companies like Jet2 and far superior to Ryanair, with a touch more legroom than both, Cabin staff were friendly and efficient, on board prices for food and drink seemed much better than the usual budget airline prices.

My original flight was booked with Opodo (Never again) the flight was booked by them through either Flybe or Virgin Airlines (I don't think I will ever know who was fully responsible) Opodo were impossible to deal with and I was unable to book my hold luggage online though they did keep sending me reminders that to book at the airport would be extortionate (their words) but when I tried to do that online with opodo I just kept getting a message saying they could not do that online, I telephoned Flybe but they said I couldn't book the hold luggage through them and would have to do it through Virgin, Virgin said they couldn't do it and I would have to do it at the Air France desk in Paris.

At the Air France check in desk they sent me to the Flybe desk who did take 50 euros from me, they don't accept cash but the very helpful staff member there paid if for me with her credit card and I paid her in cash.

My suitcase in perfect almost new condition (went to Turkey at the end of last year) went onto the plane for the short journey and you can see from the photos how it came back.

Some items in my suitcase were damaged, a broken souvenir mug from Paris (which cam amply packaged ready for an airline trip home, a none too expensive camera and a reasonably expensive camera (by my affordability but not a super price camera like many people carry) some glass souvenirs from both Athens and Paris none of which were individually expensive but of course irreplaceable for me unless I return to those places which is doubtful on my income.

Amazing room,"We stayed at this hotel for one night on the 18th February 2020, we had flown to Athens to meet up with friends from Crete who were travelling there on the overnight ferry from Crete, after a day and a half seeing the wonderful attractions Athens has to offer we all flew to Paris but our friends were so impressed when they saw the hotel and our room they booked in for tonight when they returned from Paris today with plans to get the overnight ferry back to Crete tomorrow.

Location is a short walk from the Port of Piraeus with our room giving a view of the Port and the Estuary the ships sail down to reach the Port.

Walk down towards the Port and there are a host of small shops, cafés, bars and restaurants with a couple of small café/bars just outside the hotel.

Reception and the staff there are very friendly and welcoming, it is bright and clean, all the staff we encountered were friendly and efficient.

The room was amazing, ok, so we had booked the Ambassador Suite but unlike some such suites we have stayed in, it did live up to expectations and it's title a private entrance on the 8th floor next to the standard rooms leads up through a short private staircase to a small lobby, on the left is the entrance to the infinity swimming pool with a door on the right that opens into a very large lounge that incorporates a 'president style desk', there is a coffee table and comfortable chairs, 2 large 3-4 seat settees, TV on a chest with built in fully stocked mini fridge, huge windows running along the length of the balcony a door opening into the spacious Shower room with toilet and sinks then double doors that open into the bedroom, a huge bed, wardrobes, another TV and entrance to the palatial bathroom that has a large Jacuzzi bath, double sink and toilet, both the shower room and bathroom have dressing gowns, slippers and adequate toiletries provided.

Excellent restaurant on all points,"Popped into this little café when visiting Longton, Stoke on Trent and was really pleasantly surprised at the high quality of food from a good menu range, the service was excellent, the food was excellent on the grounds of Value for money, portion size, ingredients and taste.

We had the English Breakfasts having just returned from a holiday in Turkey we fancied something traditional but not too heavy.

Everything was perfect though it was late in the day and most stores were starting to close, we could not find fault with anything from the moment we entered to the moment we left.

Lovely landscape,"An important river running through the mountains around Alanya, many beautiful viewpoints and some amazing attractions during the trip.

There are many and various organised trips to the places around the river that flows down from the amazing lake.

We drove into the area first on the Baraj Cd road which took us to the Dim Caves then crossed over onto the other side of the river using the Reglilator Cd.

There are a number of restaurants along the route, most located actually on the river with the use of floating pontoons and many have additional attractions such as fountains and swimming areas.

We stopped off at one such restaurant which had a large car park to cater for the many tourist buses that tour the attractions to be found in the area.

GOOD HOTEL BUT STAYED AT BETTER IN THE AREA,"There is nothing wrong with the Drita Hotel, it has many fine attributes but, that said I have stayed in much better hotels in the area at similar prices.

The hotel seems to struggle with descriptions, on the Love Holidays website where we booked our stay the hotel is described as ""Adults Only (Over 14) but we found not only many under 14's and many babies in push chairs but also facilities for very young children, I would estimate that more than half of the children staying at the hotel were under 14, this may be the fault of the booking agent Love Holidays but one which the hotel management need to take up with them because it is false advertising.

We opted to pay for a suite, now a suite is described in most dictionary's and Wikipedia as being ""A suite in a hotel or other public accommodation such as a cruise ship denotes, according to most dictionary definitions, connected rooms under one room number. ... In addition to one or more beds and bedroom fixtures, such ""suites"" include a living or sitting area, often equipped with a sofa bed"" our 'suite' was the Penthouse Suite, the only suite in the hotel, we expected a bathroom, bedroom and lounge as a minimum, this is what we have receive at every other suite we have ever booked and quite often they have included a second bedroom and second bathroom, what we got was a large bedroom with coffee table 2 chairs plus a large bathroom with Jacuzzi bath.and long but slim balcony.

The views are excellent and the room after the first days cleaning was excellent but appeared to have been only minimally prepared before our arrival. On the balcony there are two chairs and a small table but you have to squeeze past anyone already on the balcony to pass them.

A large TV in the bedroom shows only Turkish and German TV no English/American channels whatsoever and no Russian channels despite the high % of Russian guests who just about outnumbered the German guests, we were the only English guests and we met people from Ukraine, Poland and Turkey.

The bathroom was beautiful and large with overhead and hand held shower pieces over the Jacuzzi bath, a good sized sink and storage area for your bathroom necessities, towels were changed every day that you chose to have your room made up if required. There are limited bathroom accessories provided, shampoo and shower gel in large containers mounted on the wall.

There is a fridge in the room which you can opt to have filled on a pay for what you use basis and a 1.5 ltr bottle of water are supplied for free daily. A word of advice, leave the cupboard door to the fridge open otherwise it is like having a heater in the room and the fridge itself gets very hot (not the fridge door the cupboard door of course).

There is a good sized wardrobe in the room an plenty of drawers.

There is a kettle in the work area under the TV but the socket that powers it is broken an unusable so we had to plug the kettle in where the bedside lamp should be, there are very few sockets in the room.

Nice lighting in the suite giving the option of full lights or a mood making blue ceiling light and blue TV background light.

Housekeeping are a delight and very efficient leaving nothing undone whenever you ask them to make up the room.

Dining is totally adequate for ""all inclusive"" and each guest can use the 'al a carte' restaurant at least once as part of the all inclusive cost and more at an extra cost but again confusion over the meaning of 'a la carte' you actually get two choices but only one per night, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays you can have the set menu from the Mediterranean Menu which comprises Tomato Soup, Fish Sea Bass or Sea Bream, hot starter of Chinese Pastry OR Potato Croquets Cold Starter of Red Pepper Puree, Eggplant Salad, Hummus, Feta Cheese, Russian Salad, Green Salad and for Dessert, Stuffed Kadaifi or Kalburabasti. yes I found that confusing too and wandered which was main course and which were starters. On Mondays, Fridays and Sundays you have the Ottoman Menu with the Soup of the day, a main course described as 'Grill', hot starter of Pastry rolls or Mitite Meatball cold starter of Hummus Saksuka, Haydari (thick yoghurt with garlic and dill) Stuffed Pepper, Feta Cheese Mixed Salad and for dessert, Triliece Baklava. so there is basically no being given a menu and choosing from many options otherwise known as the cooked to order A La Carte menu.

Meals in the main restaurant consist mainly of a huge salad option, Italian area offering Spaghetti Bolognaise and Pizza, or whole baked fish (not sure which fish but looked and served in the same way we serve Trout. or the other area which changes all the time but mainly consists of a couple goulash/stew style dishes made with beef, chicken or turkey a vegetable option and potatoes mashed or chipped. the usual mixture of Turkish style sweets and fresh fruit and a bread counter. Overall we were somewhat disappointed with the food options and were surprised not to see any Pork dishes, now before you say it, we understand that Turkey mostly a Muslim Nation but at other hotels we have enjoyed many Pork dishes including cooked to order Pork Chops. Nothing was actually 'cooked to order' though some food was cooked in front of you but then piled high in the serving dishes. at previous hotels in Turkey we have enjoyed at least one cooked to order option every mealtime.

All meals seem to be orientated towards Turkish cuisine with a few German options and possibly a few Russian options.

The Beach bar does serve burgers, chicken nuggets and chips during it's opening hours.

We asked at reception to view a standard room at the request of some friends of our who were considering booking the hotel but were surprised at how small the rooms were, very small TV, simple double bed, small balcony and a very small bathroom that was a squeeze for one person and only had a walk in shower not the bath we had in our room, it was again a squeeze past the bed to the balcony.

The pool is small but because of the closeness of the beach totally adequate for the guests and used mostly by children when we were there with the obvious attraction for them of the slide.

There is also an indoor pool and many other facilities listed on their website such as extra cost services like massage and hamam.

The animation team provide a whole host of activities but the disco is 100% Turkish music which quite surprised us since English speaking Countries produce so much music and even other language Nations often produce music in English.

We were taken to the Summer Garden disco in Alanya (at extra cost) which played all Western music and was amazing.

All areas in the hotel are tastefully decorated and immaculately clean and the outside area is also clean and beautifully kept.

Staff are really friendly, efficient and eager to help, good location about 14km outside the main town of Alanya with good transport links but close to many shops including souvenir shops, clothes shops and supermarkets/chemists.

The beach is semi private, anyone can pass through it but the sunbeds and bar are for residents only and part of the all inclusive facilities, close by there is a public park with free exercise facilities, juice bar and in 50 yds in the other direction you can hire jet skis, go parasailing or on the banana boat.",October 2019,Drita Hotel Resort and Spa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1192197-d1195709-Reviews-Drita_Hotel_Resort_and_Spa-Kargicak_Alanya_Turkish_Mediterranean_Coast.html,"Kargicak, Turkey",hotels,5.0,4.0

If only for the views,"Located on the Tahtali mountain. in the grounds of Alanya Castle best accessed with an inexpensive trip on the Cable Car taking you up to visit the Castle, there is quite an extensive trek up the steps to both the grounds, the castle and more to the Restaurant itself, but once there the views of Keopatra Beach, the Harbour with it's large fleet of tourist 'Pirate ships', the sea, the mountains to the rear of Alanya .

The gardens are beautiful and the tables themselves range over various levels with varying views which does not interfere with the excellent service provided by the waiters who must be very fit running up and down all those steps that lead to each individual dining area.

The food is good and reasonably priced especially when you consider it's isolated and therefore 'cornering the market' location providing that necessary refreshment on top of the mountain and in the Castle grounds, many establishments take advantage of remote locations and hike the prices but not here.

Staff are friendly and very efficient, the heat of the October temperature (low 30s Celsius high 80s Fahrenheit) not slowing them down at all.

Another trouble free journey,"Another great flight with this airline, my 3rd this year but another 2 already booked, last year I flew to 11 destinations more than half of which were with Jet2 and each of those flights far out stripped those with the other airlines I flew with, luckily my one flight with Thomas Cook put me off booking with them ever again which proved to my advantage in the long run.

Not always the cheapest option I prefer to pay a little extra for that little 'added service' and trouble free holiday.

The trip from EMA to AYT went without incident, easy check in for our two large hold luggage bags and they as usual were happy to accept 4 carry on bags into the hold leaving us free of luggage when in the airport and on boarding. Cabin staff as check in staff were friendly, efficient and helpful.

The food on board which we had pre-ordered was average but reasonable value for money, (more of those delicious crackers but less cheese please half that size portion is adequate, love the chocolate muffins).

The flight was on time give or take 5-10 mins but we arrived at our destination on time any delay being made up on route.

The return journey went as smoothly, that is as smoothly as it can from a Turkish airport where the necessity of extra security checks are ever present, All bags checked before we got to check in, bags cabin luggage checked again at security, and then again thoroughly checked at the Gate but none of that matters to us, security is more important than speed, I want to be safe and we have learned to arrive at the airport 3-4 hours before our flight at Turkish airports.

Cabin staff on the return flight were exceptionally friendly and helpful even though it was their last flight of the day and they were no doubt tired during a flight that left around midnight for a 4 hour journey. Due to problems with the airport not Jet2 the flight was delayed by around 30 minutes but again that time was made up during the flight and we arrived in the UK on schedule.

With such things as cabin baggage being charged for with some airlines and a generous 22kg of hold luggage allowance, flying to airports closer to your final destination than some airlines (example Ryanair and Berlin or Paris) reducing the transfer costs on arrival, cheaper on board food and drink prices than rival companies Jet2 are not always as expensive as they first seem.

There is no in flight entertainment but I do enjoy listening to the Flight Crews description of the route we will take, air speed, height, weather at arrival point and general flight information very helpful an interesting.",October 2019,Jet2.com,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8729098-Reviews-Jet2com,World,flights,5.0,4.5
Nice sandy beach,"Lovely sandy beach which at times can make you think your back in the 16th Century because looking out across the ocean the horizon is full of Galleons.

Extremely long with café/bars strewn along the shoreline we stopped at Bar 18 which was very good, moderately priced with good service.

The beach is extremely popular an therefore busy with the busiest part starting close to the mountain that houses Alanya Castle but the further along the coast you go the less people on the beach, the same applies to parking, on the road opposite you can park for free but the further along you go the easier you will fin the parking.

A multitude of shops, cafés, hotels and souvenir establishments are located opposite the beach.

The promenade in front of the beach hosts a multitude of places to get a cold drink or snack and a number of small parks where you can sit in the sun or the shade. On the opposite side of the road you will find vendors selling Camel rides, not for us but we did pay the owner a few pounds to have our picture taken with them.",October 2019,Kleopatra Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297961-d554907-Reviews-Kleopatra_Beach-Alanya_Turkish_Mediterranean_Coast.html,"Alanya, Turkey",attractions,4.0,4.5
Something different,"Loved this trip to the Dim Magarasi Cavern it was something different but extremely interesting.

Amazing collection of stalactites (hanging from the ceiling) and stalagmites (growing from the floor).

There are a lot of steps, hundreds of steps so we don't recommend this unless you are at least of average fitness levels.

The mineral deposit formations are amazing formed over hundreds of thousands of years not magically built for the tourists which adds to the beauty of the sites.

There is an adequate car park for those like us who chose to drive to the attraction costing just 3 TL per car but most travel there with organised trips.

Excellent views,"We took the trip up to Alanya Castle on this very efficient cable car service, no queue whatsoever when we arrived at the ground terminal but a long queue on the way back down that was quickly despatched with each car taking 8 passengers and an operative making sure that each car was full but also ensuring that families travelled together.

Fantastic views of Kleopatra beach and the town of Alanya on the way up and also your first glimpses of the castle.

The cars (cabins) themselves are very clean with clean windows to maximise your view.

You can purchase Return or One Way tickets and we paid 28 TL per person (approximately (£2.77).

Once at the top terminal there is a substantial walk awaiting you with lot's of steps and you do need at least average walking fitness to visit the castle but worth it as the views are quite breath taking especially of Alanya Harbour, the sea, Kleopatra beach and Alanya town.
