"Lovely location, poor service","The cafe was lovely, set in a ideal location. We were seated indoors in a warehouse feel cafe and after we wandered the grounds. This is a dog friendly place. It will be great when the steakhouse, dairy, brewery & hotel are added. We had the afternoon tea for two. The food was good but it was very slow coming from the kitchen. I'd already finished my pot of tea before it arrived. I asked the waitress to explain what the savour items were as my daughter is pollo vegetarian.(Does not eat red meat) The waitress said she would go find out. She forgot and I had to ask again. She came back & said the meat was pork. So my daughter could only eat 3 out of 5 items. The sweets were nice & we received 8 scones. The jam & cream were runny so we had to asked for spoons to help spread them on our scones, as there were only knifes & forks on the table. We also had to ask for more cream. My husband had the smoked pork belly and said the fat wasn't completely rendered. Plus its was a bit expensive for what he got on his plate. Would love to come back once the service is improved.
