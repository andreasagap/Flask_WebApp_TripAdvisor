Experience on its own,"There's so much to do in the hotel grounds alone that you barely need to leave at all! There are several types of activities ranging from workshops and animal encounters to karaoke. There's a miniature ""zoo"", outdoor pools, and a fantasy park. You can put a lot of time in just exploring the grounds for all the novelties they have at place and it's all very interesting. It's a great place for families with children!

The rooms are quite big, which was impressive and the decor is very simple but functional. However the plumbing seems to be quite out of date as it was very noisy, at least that was the case in our specific vila. It was also quite weird that the doors had one actual, physical key, so if you are travelling with other people you are pretty much glued to each other whenever out and about.

The breakfast and every other dining experience is held at the same place, a restaurant in the middle of the grounds. It has a very nice rustic decor and delicious food, however on a busy night it gets incredibly hot inside and there's no air conditioning.",October 2019,Club Vila Bran,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g608956-d2399187-Reviews-Club_Vila_Bran-Bran_Brasov_County_Central_Romania_Transylvania.html,"Bran, Romania",hotels,5.0,4.0
Halloween 2019,"First of all, I visited the castle during the annual Halloween party that is hosted there, so my experience does not extend to regular operating hours.

It's a fantastic castle with an air of history to it, might be bit hard to navigate and I imagine gets crowded really quickly. There are various exhibits around the castle, ranging from the history of Vlad Tepes and Dracula myth to medieval torture devices. It's certainly a touristy location but well worth the trip if you are even little bit of a Dracula-nut!

On the downside, the castle is not accessible to those with mobility issues. There are restrooms but they are quite poorly marked, and the gift shop is very poor selection.",October 2019,Bran Castle (Dracula's Castle),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g608956-d318167-Reviews-Bran_Castle_Dracula_s_Castle-Bran_Brasov_County_Central_Romania_Transylvania.html,"Bran, Romania",attractions,5.0,4.0
My first synagogue visit,"Beautiful synagogue with a holocaust memorial right next to it, this was a lovely introduction to synagogues to me. There's a small fee to enter but it's well worth it to see the details of the inside decor. There are restrooms on the outside of the synagogue, on the opposite side of where the memorial is.

Have to admit I'm not entirely sure about the opening hours as the synagogue seemed to be closed when we first arrived, then open a little bit later, and closed as soon as we left it.",October 2019,Sinagoga Neologa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g295394-d5565566-Reviews-Sinagoga_Neologa-Brasov_Brasov_County_Central_Romania_Transylvania.html,"Brasov, Romania",attractions,5.0,4.0
Pretentious,"While the exhibits are interesting, the museum itself is quite expensive and not really worth it. It's also rather peculiar for them to require you to wear coverings over your shoes in order to enter.

Well preserved history,"This fortress is pretty much in the middle of nowhere so it might be tricky to get to. Once there, the only thing to really see is the fortress itself, which is surely amazing but might not be enough for every traveller. The ruins are interesting but there is basically no information about them as you walk among them. There are restrooms outside of the ruins themselves, so be prepared for that and do your business before entering.",October 2019,Cetatea Rupea,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g6582310-d7199473-Reviews-Cetatea_Rupea-Rupea_Brasov_County_Central_Romania_Transylvania.html,"Rupea, Romania",attractions,4.0,4.0
Great stay,"Beautiful quality hotel by the river, you'll be doing bit of uphill walking to get to the centre of the town from here. The rooms are clean and had good amount of amenities, very comfortable beds as well. The breakfast has a wide selection of different offerings for every taste.

You'll either be getting a town or a river view, both of which are quite nice.

Tourist trap,"There's no doubt about it, this place is more of a tourist trap than a historical exhibit. It's almost tacky and the souvenirs are definitely overpriced to match. However the service and food were both excellent, so it's not a loss for a Dracula lover to come here. Would not recommend going to Sighisoara only to see this place though.",October 2019,Casa Vlad Dracul,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g311309-d10310346-Reviews-Casa_Vlad_Dracul-Sighisoara_Mures_County_Central_Romania_Transylvania.html,"Sighisoara, Romania",attractions,3.0,2.5
Very narrow,"You won't miss the clock tower when in the town and it is worth taking the time to visit inside of it. Just be ready that the stairs are quite narrow, which will make it bit of a trick to pass others. On your way to the top, there are several rooms that hold historical objects for you to look at but there are no English texts available.

Historical area,"You'll likely be coming by the famous stairs that lead up to the church and if you have time to spare, might as well go all the way up. The church and the adjacent cemetery are quite beautiful, however the church's charm is mostly on its outside as the decor is quite plain. I'll also give this church a lot of respect for having informational pamphlets available in a lot of languages, the selection was the most inclusive I've seen in any other attraction to date.",October 2019,Church on the Hill,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g311309-d2646883-Reviews-Church_on_the_Hill-Sighisoara_Mures_County_Central_Romania_Transylvania.html,"Sighisoara, Romania",attractions,4.0,4.0

"Great food, lackluster service","Came here after having seen photos of some of their dishes, mainly the soup-inside-bread one. The mood of the restaurant is lovely in its traditional decor, and the food is excellent. On the downside the restaurant is also kinda expensive considering local standards, but this likely won't be an issue to many tourists since it is still affordable.

The service was the biggest ""problem"" as the waiters seemed almost confused as to why we were there and were very slow, despite there not being many other customers at the time.",October 2019,Crama Sibiana,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g295393-d1995905-Reviews-Crama_Sibiana-Sibiu_Sibiu_County_Central_Romania_Transylvania.html,"Sibiu, Romania",restaurants,3.0,3.5

Bigger on the outside,"Wandering into this museum while passing by and was surprised by how much smaller the exhibition areas were than I expected. The building is surely intimidating from the outside, but it doesn't take too long to go over the entire museum. There are different types of displays, all divided into neat sections. It's all very interesting, though it was bit disappointed that there was no English text for all of it. Still a pretty good experience.

Enough for a whole day,"Great outdoor ""museum"" of old buildings, showcasing history in a really concrete way. You can even enter some of the buildings to see reconstructed rooms. There is a lot of them as well, so you can definitely spend a whole day here learning about everything.

Just to admire the decor,"Let's be honest, you will be coming here mainly for the beautiful decor. You won't be alone, as the restaurant is constantly packed with people and extremely loud - you will not hear what someone two chairs down is saying unless they are directly yelling to you. The service is also slow because of how busy the place is and you have to keep good track of what you've ordered as the servers might forget to bring a drink to you, but they sure won't forget to charge you for it anyway!

Fantastic view,"This hotel is a bit off to the side from the main streets of the town but it comes with the trade of great ocean view (if you have a room facing that way, of course). Despite the hotel being little farther off, the distance from the center and beach isn’t terrible but it’ll be an uphill walk to get back. They have a nice outdoor dining area where they’ll play live music and have traditional dancing, in which you can participate as well. Surprisingly good sound-proofing in the room as well, the music wasn't bothersome at all.",September 2019,John & George Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1007321-d657391-Reviews-John_George_Hotel-Tolon_Argolis_Region_Peloponnese.html,"Tolon, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5
Tiny,"This museum is very small and houses some sculptures from the archaeological site. If you're there, you might as well go to the museum as well but don't be sorry if you miss it.

Mask of Agamemnon,"This small museum to the side of the archaeological site houses objects related to the place itself, so there’s no reason to skip it if you’re visiting the site itself.

Poor air,"Located bit to the side from the main archaeological site and museum, this one could be easy to overlook. Entry is included in the same ticket so it’s worth to go take a look if you have the time. It’s a relatively small museum, which was almost empty even during the peak time I visited. Considering how stuffy the air was during my visit, I would want to avoid it when there’s plenty of people!

There’s text in four different languages with the displays and photography is allowed. There’s also toilets near the museum, to its left side in a small “cabin” that might be easy to walk past but you’ll likely avoid lines by going there instead of the other places!",September 2019,Museum of the Olympic Games,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189487-d243258-Reviews-Museum_of_the_Olympic_Games-Olympia_Elis_Region_West_Greece.html,"Olympia, Greece",attractions,3.0,4.5

No photos,"There’s no doubt that the monasteries in this area wouldn’t be gorgeous and worth visiting at least one of them, but it should be noted that they are quite strict with the ‘no photos’ policy from indoors. They also do insist that women must wear skirts, so you should be dressed appropriately before arriving. The strictness about men’s dress code varies, but I’d still suggest wearing long pants and at the very least a T-shirt with sleeves. Common decency goes a long way, these are places of worship after all even if you’re just a tourist – be respectful at all times.

A Must See,"You simply can’t be in Athens without going to the Acropolis.

No photos allowed,"I had looked forward to visiting this museum and found myself rather disappointed. The place is quite big and has many fascinating artifacts, but they’ve failed to make it enjoyable to stay, which is what my rating is based on. The air is extremely stale, felt like there was no air conditioning and I witnessed three people actually collapse during my visit. This is made worse by the fact that there are barely any places to sit while you’re trying to enjoy the exhibits. The nail in the coffin is surely the fact that they don’t allow photos and the staff are very aggressive about enforcing this. Honestly wouldn’t bother with this one again.",September 2019,Skip the Line: Athens New Acropolis Museum Ticket,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g189400-d12835132-Skip_the_Line_Athens_New_Acropolis_Museum_Ticket-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",activities,1.0,4.5
Good stay and service,"My room was okay, but bit of a tight fit with the layout from the door. Had a ""corner room"" so to speak. Wasn’t cleaned too well considering that found hair in the bathroom. The breakfast room is at the top of the hotel and has a gorgeous view of the Acropolis, which was very lovely but the breakfast room is quite tiny so you better hope there aren't many others coming at the same time!

Poor visit,"For a hotel touting itself under ‘premium’ this was a subpar accommodation at best. The lobby area looks extravagant but the actual room was terrible. It was tiny and the bathroom was tinier still, you couldn’t even sit on the toilet without your legs hitting the tub, the door, and the sink plumbing all at the same time! The plumbing was also incredibly noisy for several minutes after you flushed, so I doubt the building’s plumbing is up to code. Everything else was noisy as well, the room was on a high floor but you could still clearly hear a lot of partying from below. Uncomfortable, hard bed and only one of everything for two people (one blanket, one towel, etc). There were also surveys to fill about your stay but they didn’t provide pens, assuming because they actually don’t want your opinion. Luckily it was a short stay and would never return to this hotel again.",August 2019,Premier Hotel Rus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g294474-d305214-Reviews-Premier_Hotel_Rus-Kyiv_Kiev.html,"Kyiv (Kiev), Ukraine",hotels,1.0,4.0
No signage,"I never made it inside because there didn’t seem to be any signs in English telling you where you could do so.

Would tour with them again,"Professionally organized and you could tell they were experienced just from the effortless way the tour operator handled everything. He was even kind enough to wait a little while after the allocated departure time for some people who hadn’t yet arrived and made sure everyone had proper equipment for the trip (passport, clothing, etc).

Our guide was knowledgeable and laidback, he made sure we followed the itinerary to see everything promised but still allowed us enough free time for plenty of photos.

Worth the visit,"Good sized museum in a central location, it’s free of charge so it’s certainly worth the visit. The museum covers many conflicts throughout history, naturally focusing more on the Swedish perspective when it comes to world wars. There’s a lot of information and almost all of it is also provided in English. There are also some interactive displays, which brings an extra layer of interest to the place.

Interesting for the whole family,"Very central location so you are bound to walk by this museum and might as well take a look inside. Despite what it seems like from the outside, the museum is actually quite small and only consists of one hall. There’s still plenty of interesting displays and during my visit I noticed that children specially seemed to find a lot of entertainment in the area.

Royal resting place,"One of the oldest Swedish churches, you’d expect this to be little more impressive but it is rather mediocre. The church has an important place in history and still holds some of the remains of the royal families that have ruled over the country. It is probably the biggest selling point to come see their resting places, but regretfully you aren’t really allowed to properly see the ones in the ‘crypt’ area. Not a must visit but if you are in the area then you might as well take a look inside. You can purchase a separate admission ticket but you can also have a joined ticket for the Royal Palace and this church.",August 2019,Riddarholm Church (Riddarholmskyrkan),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189852-d244315-Reviews-Riddarholm_Church_Riddarholmskyrkan-Stockholm.html,"Stockholm, Sweden",attractions,3.0,4.0
Small,This little museum is located pretty much under the Royal Palace and you can visit it with the same ticket as for the Palace itself. It wouldn’t really be worth it to come here on its own as the museum is very tiny and doesn’t really have much of anything special to showcase about the former palace.,August 2019,Museum Tre Kronor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189852-d8444125-Reviews-Museum_Tre_Kronor-Stockholm.html,"Stockholm, Sweden",attractions,2.0,3.5
Be sure to visit when in Stockholm,"Central location so when you are visiting Stockholm, you’re bound to notice the Palace at some point. The same admission ticket allows you entry to the royal apartments, the royal chapel, the armoury, the treasury, and two little museums that center around history of the palace right next to the palace itself. It’s plenty to see with one ticket so you surely get your money’s worth, and with little extra you can also include a visit to the nearby Riddarholmen Church which holds the remains of some members of the Swedish royals.

If you’ve visited palaces before then this one isn’t anything shocking, on the contrary you might be finding the Swedish palace to be much more down to earth than others. It is still interesting to take a look around, and you will likely have a lot more breathing room than in other similar sites. I visited during peak time and yet could fully take in several locations without a crowd, even walking through the hall of mirrors completely alone!

One point of critique for the Royal Apartments would be how dark it was there. They had elected to keep all the heavy curtains closed and so it was very dimly lit.",August 2019,The Royal Palace in Stockholm Admission Ticket,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g189852-d16796071-The_Royal_Palace_in_Stockholm_Admission_Ticket-Stockholm.html,"Stockholm, Sweden",activities,5.0,4.0
Overpriced,"This hotel is in a central location in the city and a large portion of sights are within walking distance. The rooms are quite spacious while the bathrooms seem to be surprisingly small, at least this was the case for the room I stayed in. The room doesn’t come with usual comforts you might expect from a fancier place like this, which was surprising. The beds are comfortable and the room is clean, like the rest of the hotel. The staff respect the “Do Not Disturb” sign.

Breakfast at the hotel is pretty good, the selection is impressive and the service is fast. Only thing lacking is the option of fruits available. Overall I had a pleasant stay at Scandic Park, but I can’t rate it higher due to not feeling like the value for my money was right. It was quite overpriced rate for what was present.",August 2019,Scandic Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189852-d229347-Reviews-Scandic_Park-Stockholm.html,"Stockholm, Sweden",hotels,3.0,4.0
Get more than you expect!,"For a budget hotel Ville is surprisingly high end. I stayed in a single room with a private bathroom and was pleasantly taken back by how spacious the room and bathroom were, with a ton of amenities. The room had a mini fridge, microwave, electric fan, both electric kettle and coffee maker, and plates and eating utensils. Additionally they had provided dish soap! The cleanliness of the room was up to bar, I had no complaints over anything in the room. Even the general noise level was lower than I expected, considering that the hotel is located next to a busy street.

Location is great, quite close to the city center and bus station. The walk is straightforward but there’s also a bus service with a stop right next to the hotel/restaurant. The building itself may seem low end from the outside but is decently renovated from the inside. Check-in was incredibly quick and done at the restaurant since there is no check-in office, so I might count that as a slight minus that you are obligated to arrive to the hotel during the restaurant’s open hours. There’s no elevator, so coming with heavy luggage might be an issue if you have to haul it all the way to the top floor and other end of the building.

Also worth noting that there’s no breakfast at this hotel, but there’s a supermarket across the street so you can buy some basic breakfast supplies to make something in your room. For my needs this was a great property and if I’ll have a need to stay in Tampere again, I’ll most likely stay at Hotel Ville.",August 2019,Hotelli Ville,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189948-d2049652-Reviews-Hotelli_Ville-Tampere_Pirkanmaa.html,"Tampere, Finland",hotels,5.0,4.0
No photography allowed,"Boasting itself to be the world’s first espionage museum, this little place is tucked away inside a foodcourt/mall of sorts. There are plenty of signs so you will find it and might even take a look at everything else going on. The size of the museum itself is quite small as it is basically just one room with displays of gadgets and information posters along the walls. There’s some interactive portions, like being able to walk through a tunnel where you’ll be “spied upon” or partaking in some activities of solving mysteries.

The museum has done quite a good job in looking at espionage from a global perspective rather than local, but there’s a lot of information that is only displayed in Finnish. Interestingly there were couple instances where they had supplied Russian translation for an object or two, but there was no more than that. I guess you can just read the information online anyway, but considering the quite steep entry price and the fact that they don’t allow any photography it’s not a good trade off.",August 2019,Spy Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189948-d297206-Reviews-Spy_Museum-Tampere_Pirkanmaa.html,"Tampere, Finland",attractions,2.0,3.5
Take a picture with Lenin and Stalin,"This museum is the first Lenin museum that was founded outside of the Soviet Union and also simultaneously the last to remain to this day. It is located in the very same building where Lenin and Stalin first met each other, so it is quite a historical building on its own.

The architecture of the building is interesting to look at and the museum is easy to locate within, the museum itself consist only of one large room. As you’d expect it focuses on Lenin’s life as well the Soviet Union in general, with a lot of talk about Stalin on the side.

The displays are decent and offered in three languages – Finnish, Russian and English. There’s also a photo opportunity with dummies of Lenin and Stalin, you can even dress up for it. Decent museum, would recommend for those interest in history or if you just happen to be in the area.",August 2019,Lenin Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189948-d297204-Reviews-Lenin_Museum-Tampere_Pirkanmaa.html,"Tampere, Finland",attractions,4.0,4.0

Expensive but good museum,"Good museum in a central location, only short walk away from the train station and bus terminal. The entry fee is a bit steep but you are allowed to come and go from the museum with the same ticket during the day, and the lockers for your belongings are free. There is also a lunch cafe on site, which seemed to be fairly decent and not too expensive.

The museum itself spans several floors and is very nicely laid out, allowing you to view everything in orderly fashion. Information is available in three languages, but on some occasions English is missing.

Bit of a surprise,"Located on two floors inside an electronics shop near the marina, this small exhibit is free to visit at your leisure. There is no staff and very minimal information, but I suspect anyone coming to visit is there for the nostalgia more than anything else. It’s worth taking a look if you are arriving/leaving the city via a ferry but not really worth the trouble to specifically come see.

"Good decor, that's about it","Themed maritime restaurant, the decor of this place is very well thought out and serves to create a nice atmosphere. However that's where my compliments end: during our visit there didn't seem to be any type of air conditioning at all. It wasn't even incredibly hot day (around 24°C/73°F) and not many other guests were in the restaurant at the time, yet the air was absolutely dead. Very uncomfortable to sit and resulted in just hurrying to eat so could get out to breathe.

The food was rather poor, I truly expected a delicious fish to come out of this themed restaurant but found it watery and flavorless.

Steps into the building,"Bit to the side, this hotel is more of a stop for anyone intending to only stay the night and continue traveling in the morning. It's close to the highway so a good choice for anyone driving. It's worth noting that the entrance to the hotel includes steps, so it is difficult for hard of mobility to enter this building.

The hotel has a peculiar lock system that seemed to be causing a lot of guests issues in not being able to access their rooms without a member of staff coming up to aid them.

Good quality stay,"Good location, a walking distance away from the centre and excellent for any train traveler as the station is a coin toss away. There's also a Rewe (supermarket) very close that is open late if you find yourself in need of a snack after late arrival.

Very spacious hotel with an air of luxury to it, the rooms are comfortable and clean. However wifi is somewhat of an issue if it decides to work or not, and there's nothing to be done if it simply won't work.

Kitchen staff seemed disinterested in their jobs, witnessed several different guests noting something missing from the buffet and they were only met with indifference.

I need couple extra services from the staff, including my meal at a later date than originally agreed upon. The staff were very accommodating and friendly over these burdens I placed on them.

I recommend buying your ticket in advance.

The 'main attractions' are clearly marked in the museum map and for those only heading to see Mona Lisa, there are continuous signs to keep you on the right direction.

There will always be a crowd no matter when you visit, so be prepared to move in close promixity with other visitors. Only place to get some breathing room is when walking the vast gardens area. I'd suggest getting a guided tour simply because waiting in line before the entrance takes a long while and there's no shelter from sun or rain.
