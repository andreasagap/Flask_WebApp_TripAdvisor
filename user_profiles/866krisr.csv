Best Meal we have on BVI trip,"Perfect setting, very friendly staff and fresh food for a small island venue. They happily accommodated 16 of us at one large table. Seafood was delicious and the vegetables were fresh. The bread plate was fantastic! Wine menu was great too with a lot of options that didn't break the bank.",February 2020,Cooper Island Beach Club Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g2674307-d1062790-Reviews-Cooper_Island_Beach_Club_Restaurant-Cooper_Island_British_Virgin_Islands.html,Cooper Island,restaurants,4.0,4.5
Our favorite mooring in the BVI,"This is our favorite place (especially with Saba Rock / Bitter End closed) and always spend two of our 8 nights here when we're on our bareboat vacation. It's a gorgeous setting, the restaurant, coffee bar and Rum bar are excellent. It's easy to take a dingy up to Cistern point to snorkle. Great place to spend a few days!

This time we were able to secure our mooring through the new Boaty Ball app but while we were just off the two main docks, we were in a kind of swirly / odd current area. Normally our mooring ball has been a calm, easy swim to shore experience. Not sure what was going on this year but you could see the boats all swinging around in all different directions, strange!",February 2020,Cooper Island Beach Club,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g2674307-d150923-Reviews-Cooper_Island_Beach_Club-Cooper_Island_British_Virgin_Islands.html,Cooper Island,hotels,5.0,5.0
Perfect place to stay if you're just passing through for the night.,"Easy to walk to/from terminals. They have a free shuttle bus that takes you to downtown Rome. We had a flight that arrived at 7pm and we were able to pick up luggage, walk to hotel, get checked in and make the 8pm shuttle bus to go into town for dinner. Easy and no stress! Took their last shuttle back to hotel and left the next morning on an early flight.

The hotel / rooms are what you'd expect. Nothing fancy, a wee bit tired and worn, but it's what we imagined for the price and felt it was a good value. The staff was very efficient and friendly. Would do this again for an ""overnight"" layover type situation. If we had two nights or more we'd stay in downtown Rome.",September 2019,Hilton Rome Airport Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g656615-d228406-Reviews-Hilton_Rome_Airport_Hotel-Fiumicino_Province_of_Rome_Lazio.html,"Fiumicino, Italy",hotels,4.0,3.5
"Why not, maybe your wish will come true?","If you're in old town it's right in striking distance. It would be a shame to not see it, touch his toe and make a wish.

Stay in Old Split!,"We enjoyed staying in old town. You have the opportunity to easily enjoy it daytime as well as night time.

"Meh - not the best view for sunset, but unique setting for sure.","Hanging outside the wall this was a fun place to find. If you do the ""wall walk"" you can look over the edge and see it - it's an inviting looking spot! It takes a bit to seek it our and we learned there is Buza 1 and Buza 2. We went to both and I think I would enjoy it more during the daytime. We went at sunset and it was crowded and you couldn't really see the full sunset (couldn't see the sun drop into the sea from our angle / time of year). A great place to watch the sunset is the Rooftop Bar at the hotel, Villa Dubrovnik (about a 10 minute walk outside the Ploce gate).",September 2019,Cafe Buza,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g295371-d552668-Reviews-Cafe_Buza-Dubrovnik_Dubrovnik_Neretva_County_Dalmatia.html,"Dubrovnik, Croatia",attractions,3.0,4.0
Go at night - gorgeous with lights and you'll probably catch live music!,"We went here both during the day and at night. Different experiences and equally nice but on a warm evening, seeing it all light up and hearing live music - gave it a special significance.

We waited in line for quite a while but at least we were able to get a glass of wine while we stood and waited. My only complaint is it seemed obvious that other ""2 tops"" were seated in front of us that came much later and also didn't have reservations. Oh well, we're on vacation - don't get fussed, right!

Mexican Food in Croatia with all that great seafood? Yup.,"Great find for something different. I find it hard to believe but we were ready for a break from the fabulous Mediterranean inspired dishes and fresh seafood we'd been eating in Croatia but this hit the spot.

SUPERB - When can I go back!!!,"My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights and didn't want to leave. The property was absolutely gorgeous, all parts of it! Their ""beach"" (rock/concrete outcroppings that reminded me of the Amalfi Coast) area was so relaxing and perfect for those who love to swim in the sea. The lunch and dining areas were so comfortable and inviting. The entrance to the hotel was unique and stunning. Their rooftop bar and deck was large and so fantastic for taking in the sunset. We continued to find cool outdoor spaces all around the property and everything was so thoughtfully attended to. Loved the overall ""feel"".

1) LOCATION: Hotel location was ideal - easy walk to town (though they always have a consistent shuttle which was also handy) and far enough away to feel happily out of the fray.
2) VIEWS: Views were outstanding - looking back at the old town and across to Lokrum island. Perfect place to watch the sun dip into the sea. We thought the sunset was better here than from Old Town.
3) BEACH/POOL: Awesome access to sea & cool sun lounging area w/ drink & food service. They also had an indoor pool with lounge area just outside the indoor pool.
4) FOOD: One word, spectacular. Having lunch on their stunning outdoor patio area was an absolute pleasure. It was nicely shaded, the service was attentive and professional without being stuffy and the food was easily in the top meals we had in all of Croatia. The ROOFTOP BAR was also a great selling point! Even if you aren't staying here I would come here for sunset and for meals!
5) ACCOMODATIONS: Rooms were modern, beds & linens were very comfortable, bathrooms large and modern as well. All rooms face the sea so you have a nice view.
6) STAFF: Friendly and accommodating but didn't ""over-serve"".
7) SERVICES: Transportation to/from ferry or to/from airport was easily arranged w/ hotel and worked perfectly. Also free shuttle to/from old town. Hotel was very clean and housekeeping was great. We did not use the SPA but I'm sure it was great?
8) STUNNING PROPERTY: The lovely pictures you find in researching this place are accurate - sometimes you see the image gallery on the hotel sites and then get there and are under-whelmed. NOT the case here. It is as you imagine!
9) BOTTOM LINE: It really just felt ""great"" and I would say all the guests around us clearly felt the same. Lots of satisfied travelers!",September 2019,Villa Dubrovnik,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g295371-d308208-Reviews-Villa_Dubrovnik-Dubrovnik_Dubrovnik_Neretva_County_Dalmatia.html,"Dubrovnik, Croatia",hotels,5.0,4.5
"Easy Accommodations, rooms priced for many budgets","We normally tend to stay at smaller, boutique hotels when traveling on vacation but in researching for this leg of the trip and because we were just here a few days this place was a great solution. There are rooms priced for varied budgets, many activitiy options serving different types of guests and the hotel location is ideal. Arriving from ferry is easy - a van efficiently transports your luggage while you take an easy walk over to the hotel. The breakfast buffet is absolutely HUGE. The pool / beach is also HUGE and provides options to either lounge by the massive pool area or head down to the beach / sea. Good to know - they provide a beach towel for use each day that you ""check in and out"".

Fabulous Seafood Lunch in Paradise,"Maybe the best meal I had in Croatia. The tuna was so fresh, simple and perfectly done. All our selections were fantastic.

"Hvar Boats = Fantastic, reliable company for a private boat tour!","Excellent communication throughout the process from booking our trip weeks ahead of time to the day of our boat trip. Very responsive. Not only was it helpful but it also gave us confidence that we were booking with a good company. Great company to work with! As for our private boat trip day – super fun and a great way to see the beaches and neighboring islands. Our captain, Nikola was fantastic. He was perceptive in what we would enjoy and flexible to our route. He made great suggestions for our day and was very knowledgeable about the area which added to the experience.

We LOVED the sweet potato fries w/ peanuts, house made sriracha and garlic mayo (see picture)! What a unique combination of flavors and it was outstanding.

The rooms were really cool - exposed stone wall, wood ceiling w/ beams, chandelier - looked exactly like the photos.

Also food and drinks available at a pretty outdoor seating area.

"Remote, special spot. Great for Sunset!","We weren't able to enjoy this as a day-long beach club experience as the weather didn't cooperate but we had an outstanding meal here! Guess we'll just have to go back! As a comparison - two main differences from this beach club versus La Fontelina and Da Luigi beach clubs on the other side of the island:

1) Personally we love swimming in the sea, but unlike La Fontelina and Da Luigi beach clubs on the other side of the island, this place has a nice pool if you're not up to swimming in the sea (or if it is too rough / seas too large and they don't allow access to the sea ... which can happen).
2) The views have different yet equal appeal - all are great. This side of the island has a better sunset view while La Fontelina & Da Luigi have stunning views of the Faraglioni Rocks.

We had amazing food here and super great service - all with a beautiful sunset view. It was one of two of our favorite meals on the island.",September 2019,Lido del Faro,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g488299-d1319816-Reviews-Lido_del_Faro-Anacapri_Island_of_Capri_Province_of_Naples_Campania.html,"Island of Capri, Italy",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Just expect to spend some money and enjoy yourself! It's worth it.,"Just come with the expectation of spending some money and enjoying yourself. Having been to the neighboring beach club as well, I can say it's worth spending more and coming here. Outstanding service, nicely kept place. Super fun beach/swim/sun/long lunch/relax type day. Very clean bathrooms on site with amenities to change, shower and such. Very attentive, but relaxed (definitely not over the top), beach service. Good swimming, sunning, people watching AND eating! This was one of two of the best meals / food we had on Capri.

Wanted to love it but ...,"We had been at La Fontelina (beach club next door) the previous day and wanted to spend a day here as well. I will say, it was very windy the day we came here (no fault of theirs) and getting toward the end of season (Sep 20th or so) BUT, the attendants helping with renting loungers and providing towels was quite rude. He seemed upset we were even there. After we were handed towels they said pick a spot and that was the last we saw of anyone. There wasn't any drink service - you had to go find your own. The towels were paper thin/awful and the property overall seemed pretty run down. On a positive, the food was good (not as good as La Fontelina which was unreal!) and the servers at the restaurant were very nice and it was good service. We had a big lunch and a few bottles of wine throughout the day - trying to support the establishment but I wouldn't bother to come back here.",September 2019,Da Luigi ai Faraglioni,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187783-d3395719-Reviews-Da_Luigi_ai_Faraglioni-Capri_Island_of_Capri_Province_of_Naples_Campania.html,"Island of Capri, Italy",restaurants,3.0,3.5

The staff was very accommodating both before and during our stay. Giovanni in the pool bar / breakfast area was AWESOME! Very helpful with tips about places to go and things to do and of course taking care of us around the pool and at breakfast. Michele was quick to respond to my questions prior to arriving and during the arrival process when we were able to catch an earlier ferry and so forth. Easy communications throughout. We knew we were in a great spot as whenever shop keepers asked where we were staying and we said, ""Villa Brunella"" they were always very complimentary of the lovely family owned property!

We stayed in a Junior Suite, 1 bedroom, terrace, sea-view. Room was large and had a large balcony. Bed and pillows were very comfortable and the linens were nice. Bathroom was also very big.

Best dish we had was their grilled octopus which was absolutely superb. Otherwise, we thought our other dishes (ordered several appetizers and two different entrees) were good but nothing to write home about. The wine list was a MASSIVE book and slightly overwhelming.

Perfect Location Fantastic Service,"Centrally located - situated within walking distance of all the major areas / sites you want to visit in the heart of Rome. The rooms were very modern and comfortable - beds/pillows/linens very nice and comfortable. The breakfast and rooftop bar area were superb. The service by the staff was very accommodating – both via email before our visit (to help set up dinner reservations etc) and during our stay. We Would definitely stay here again! Few things that would have helped us to know:

1) The rooftop bar is very nice but it seems that most nights you need a reservation to have a drink around sunset even if you’re staying at the hotel. There isn’t unlimited room / seating and we weren’t allowed to just stand and have a drink. So, if you want to watch the sunset one night be sure to let them know, perhaps even ahead of your visit?

2) Access by car would be difficult (not a problem for us as we choose not to drive in this area of Rome!) but it sounds like they arrange for parking. Even our car service dropped us off on a busy street and we had to quickly get out and walk a bit to the entrance down a busy street. It seems like there is a back road that is quieter and closer to the entrance of the hotel but think access to that road was unavailable due to streets closed for a political event but ….

This is a big region not a specific place/single destination!,"I've lived in Hood River for a long time and get this question often from visitors, ""where is The Scenic Columbia River Gorge""? It struck me as such a funny question but after I heard it many times I realize visitors think there is a defined, specific destination - a single place where you go to see ""The Scenic Columbia River Gorge"".

Most travelers likely realize or figure out that it is a large area (maybe spanning 80+ miles) with many scenic places to visit and many activities to pursue from windsurfing and kiting to hiking, biking, kayaking, rafting, fishing, camping and wine tasting! I could go on and on.

A short drive takes you up to some Cascade highlights like Mt Hood on the Oregon side which is open for skiing/snowboarding all summer and Mt Adams on the Washington side.

"Important Archaeological Site, worth it!","We were on the fence about whether to go to Delos but as we were traveling in Athens and Mykonos - many locals we talked with suggested we must visit Delos and some considered it an even more important piece of history than the Acropolis / Parthenon. We are so glad we went. We weren't excited about crowding onto a boat with a big group of people but it was worth it. A few practicalities to note:

1) this is often sold as an inclusive tour - boat ticket, entrance ticket and a tour guide. (we are NOT fans of big tour groups but this seemed the best way to attack this attraction and we ended up enjoying the tour guide - only about 10 in our group - and would have missed out on a lot without having a guide.
2) there is no shade and really no amenities
3) 2 or 3 boats will converge on this island around the same time, and then leave around the same time. Depending on season either 2 trips a day or maybe 3 in the peak season. The guides do a good job of trying to spread everyone out so you can see the ruins.
4) the boat ride is short and not that rough unless it is very windy (which it is often windy)",September 2018,Archaeological Site of Delos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g202339-d4297568-Reviews-Archaeological_Site_of_Delos-Delos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Delos, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Fantastic option for guided tour - Great Experience!,"We were so excited to have such a great experience using Tours by Locals to find a private guide!

Particular to our guide - we were in Athens and hired Nota.

"Nice atmosphere, good seafood & pasta","We were wandering around and hungry on our first night in Mykonos and were enticed by their outdoor seating and the nice evening. We didn't have reservations and the restaurant was pretty full - we were quickly escorted to a table in the far back (never a great feeling) but it was still in the outside area and turned out to be a nice place to sit. We found the service to be very friendly and efficient - had a bottle of wine, shared a salad, an appetizer and two entrees. All great dishes and recommendation for the wine was spot on. It was a nice experience and no regrets but wow ... there are a lot of places to eat in Mykonos Old Town!",September 2018,Familia Omerta di Cucina,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g662620-d2195379-Reviews-Familia_Omerta_di_Cucina-Mykonos_Town_Mykonos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Mykonos, Greece",restaurants,4.0,3.5
Great setting. Nice servers. Good Food.,"Without the setting I'm not sure I would give this 4 stars. The food is good but not overly memorable. However, the setting IS part of why many people go to a restaurant and this is a GREAT opportunity to have drinks and good food and watch the sun set on the Acropolis and then the lights come on. Fantastic! Start with drinks in the outdoor bar area to watch the sun go down and then move inside for a nice dinner. However, if you're looking for a spot to have just drinks and appetizers during sunset, this may not be your place as they don't really serve food during this time (they have just two options if you want a snack with your drinks - a cheese plate or a meat and cheese plate). The dinner menu has a fair amount of variety and all four of us thought our dishes were quite good. The servers were fantastic.",September 2018,Electra Roof Garden Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d2587968-Reviews-Electra_Roof_Garden_Restaurant-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Keep walking ...,"We didn't seek this place out but stumbled upon it walking back from visiting the Acropolis / Acropolis museum. We should have scouted out some other places first.

Fascinating Market,Recommend going down early in the morning - I walked down around 7:30 while vendors were still setting up and getting ready.

Worth the Effort,This is an important archaeological site and is very impressive to stand on these grounds and imagine the history. Even with many tourists coming through it didn't feel overly crowded and you could wait for groups to pass in order to enjoy a more un-impeded view. The view over Athens was also really amazing. We toured the grounds first and then the Acropolis museum after and we liked having been on the site first - it added to the museum experience.,September 2018,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5

Nice location and great rooftop view,"Easy location - walking distance shopping, eating, sightseeing etc. Modern hotel, rooms that were very nice and clean. Staff was helpful.

Exceeded Expectations - enjoyable stay!,"We would definitely stay here again – yes, the room was nice and of course the pool and view exceptional (!) but the real reason to return is the amazing people, top to bottom, who run the property! From reception and housekeeping to servers and bartenders we couldn’t have enjoyed it more! Thanks so much to all but especially to these fun and excellent people: bartender Sakis and servers Antonia and Bana! You made our stay a fun and enjoyable experience!

Food was great – breakfast was delicious and many, many choices. The food at the pool was outstanding as was the view. Great to wander around the island and then return late afternoon for a bite to eat and drinks around the pool – lingering until the sun sets. Incredible!

We stayed in a suite with a sea view and a huge balcony (I think it was room 127) which was very spacious and enjoyable – would stay in the room again.

Location was great – quick walk to old town and conveniently … directly across the street from the hotel entrance was a car / scooter rental.",September 2018,Vencia Boutique Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g662620-d529731-Reviews-Vencia_Boutique_Hotel-Mykonos_Town_Mykonos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Mykonos, Greece",hotels,5.0,5.0
Deserves More Than 5 Stars!,"Luxury + impeccable service without being pretentious. A fantastic, relaxing and enjoyable stay – we had fun with the staff who were extremely professional and exceptional at their jobs yet easy going and fun to interact with. We stayed in the “Odysseus” suite which was two floors and very charming – we would choose this room again.

The breakfast was fantastic as was lunch / drinks poolside! All the food here was exceptional and the servers and bartenders were phenomenal - we really enjoyed them all – great group! The concierge staff was also fantastic, very kind and so accommodating and helpful with reservations and tips about where to go, what to do etc. The transportation services the hotel provides were excellent. Housekeeping was impeccable. Every experience top to bottom was outstanding – well anticipated and thought through. A+ staff on all levels – everyone we encounter was very accommodating and kind.

Great Bar Food and Drinks,"Fun atmosphere, happy people, nice servers and bartenders. We were here during The Masters which is an insanely busy time for the town and they efficiently handled the crowds. Everything we tried was great ""bar food"" and was surprised that we loved the Buffalo Chicken Dip with house-made tortilla chips so much.

Location is Ideal for roaming Buckhead,"We stayed here passing through for 2 nights before flying to another destination as we wanted to check out Atlanta. We had a corner suite with views - large room, clean, and comfortable. It was easy to walk around the Buckhead area as well as access the freeways from here. Other than the awful, and unpredictable Atlanta traffic it was easy to get back to the airport as well.",April 2018,The Westin Buckhead Atlanta,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60898-d114382-Reviews-The_Westin_Buckhead_Atlanta-Atlanta_Georgia.html,"Atlanta, Georgia",hotels,4.0,4.5
A Must for Porsche Fans,"Even a non-Porsche fan would enjoy the car ""museum"" on the first few floors and the restaurant. There is also a small gift shop on site. We did not drive on this trip but spent time wandering around and watching the track from the observation deck. Nothing like the sweet sounds of a Porsche on the track! If you haven't been, this is right at the Atlanta airport so flying in for a track day is very do-able. However, if you don't have reservations you can't access the premise so if you were just hoping to check out the facility you'd need to call ahead and try to get Visitor Passes. I'm not sure if they always grant them?",April 2018,Porsche Experience Center Atlanta,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60898-d8380237-Reviews-Porsche_Experience_Center_Atlanta-Atlanta_Georgia.html,"Atlanta, Georgia",attractions,5.0,5.0
"Nice Wine List, Varsity Servers, Entrees were ""ok""","We were here during The Masters so I really appreciate that the hosts, servers, bartenders were all so friendly as I'm sure it is not their favorite week ... their town gets so over-run with tourists. The wine list had a great selection of reds for our tastes (I believe they bring in some additions for this week) and the service was professional and efficient. Waiting for a table was ""ok"" - you could get a drink or bottle of wine but no food which we thought was odd and a bummer as everyone waiting for their table was starving. The entrees were well prepared but nothing special.

YUP ... good airport food and wine!!,"Good reason to go to the airport early - we saw this place when we flew in but who wants to have a snack in the airport when you arrive! Luckily we were plenty early for our flight home and spent an hour here. Wine was very good, food was very good and bartender was awesome! Sit at the bar, charge your phone, drink good wine and have surprising good airport food! The salted carmel white chocolate cookie was the best cookie I have had in YEARS and I eat a lot of cookies. The non sweet tooths in our group even raved and I bought another to take home. The Panini whether hot or cold were great - in our group we had three different ones and all were delicious. (I liked the Panini w/ pecorino, fig jam and arugula!) The salads were good too.

Unpredictable. Shame on me for thinking otherwise!,"I can't give this lower than 3 stars because hey, it's NATURE and that means it is unpredictable! Shame on me for thinking otherwise, right. My guess is, if you hit this right it is a pretty fantastic sight to take in. We really wanted to see this but after waiting for 45 minutes we left without seeing the bats.

Surprised how efficiently they can handle HUGE crowds.,We were here for Formula 1. Not many chances to see Formula 1 in North America so had to go. Having been to many large events I was impressed with how well COTA handled the crowds. Bathrooms and concessions were well managed and we waited in line way less than anticipated. We had seats but General Admission would have been fine as we went to many places on the track for different viewing. Wear very comfortable shoes of course if you're going to move around a lot (according to my iPhone we walked 10 miles that day!). My big warning though is unless you have access to VIP tent etc there is VERY limited place to get out of the blazing sun or pouring rain. I wonder if the beer gardens are always that full or more so because it was 97 degrees and no where to hide. ??,October 2017,Circuit of The Americas,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g30196-d3645477-Reviews-Circuit_of_The_Americas-Austin_Texas.html,"Austin, Texas",attractions,4.0,4.5
Brunch - Worth the wait.,"Delicious Brunch. Tasty Bloody Mary's and very good espresso. Inventive selection of both breakfast and lunch items. Instead of table ""bread"" they server these amazing little corn muffins which were fantastic. Of course that didn't stop me from also ordering their house specialty - Sweet Potato Beignets - served fresh and warm, tossed in brown butter & allspice w/ creme fraiche. Yum. Their take on Eggs Benedict was unique - they offered traditional but their Crab cake style was a fun deviation. The Migas dish was awesome.

Great rooftop seating & atmosphere. Average food.,"I'd give this a ""4"" for the setting, margaritas and appetizer fare but only a ""2-3"" for meals. It was fun vantage point for people watching and we were thirsty and starving after having just arrived in Austin so ended up staying and eating. I would come again for a drink and appetizer but not stay for dinner. Tableside Guacamole was great as was the Brisket Quesadilla with roasted poblanos, carmelized onions & serrano raspberry bbq sauce. The ceviche was too salty for us - might have been an off batch?
