Our room was huge with everything we needed for our 4 night stay, and so spotlessly clean.wasn't a huge fan of our bathroom as I would have liked a bath,if we stayed longer would have probably asked to have moved.But the walk in shower did us for the time we was there.

Christmas shopping trip,"This hotel is located quite central and is surrounded by lots of good restaurants and bars.Hotel reception staff really friendly.
On the whole we were not overly impressed by the quality of this hotel. We found it to be very low budget rooms.On arrival the room was very clean but over the few days of being there the cleaner didn't do a great job at all, although we had clean towels daily. The room we stayed in was very hot and stuffy, but having the window open at night was not a option as the road is very busy. The beds are a bad design all round for two large adults. The T.V blink.and you would miss it ,it really is that small. 12"" Do they even make T.V that small,and no I don't go away to watch T.V but sometimes it's nice to have a bit of background noise.
The shower was terrible,had no pressure at all just a dribble,we mentioned it to reception but they said they didn't understand.
The pictures are after the cleaner has been and made the beds,and cleaned!
