Beautiful Steak,"Very nice cosy place nice atmosphere. Waitress was wonderful (shame can't remember her name) very happy smiley lady.
Speed of service was excellent.
Both meals were well presented, nice and hot and the steak was perfect.
Highly suggest a visit.",September 2019,Jaba Grill and Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g255118-d14211977-Reviews-Jaba_Grill_and_Bar-Christchurch_Canterbury_Region_South_Island.html,"Christchurch, New Zealand",restaurants,4.0,5.0
Wonderful Delight,"Dropped in at 12.30pm on the off chance for lunch. Very busy but got a nice table.
Introduction & service at reception a bit slow but polite.
The downside first: The tables have been laid out to really use the space and you could feel slightly clostrphobic and shut in. It was awkward getting to our table amongst many people. Even the waitress had problems getting us to the table.
The Upside: The food was wonderful. Fresh and tasty with a very good selection catering for varied taste buds.
The Biggest Upside was our waitress Renae: What a refreshingly delightful lady to have serve you. She was fantastic. Polite, funny, engaging and knew her job so very well. We would go back here again just to receive her delightful service.
Overall a nice experience and a great place to go if alone or with friends for good food at very reasonable cost.
Highly recommend.",August 2019,Valentines,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g255118-d17679302-Reviews-Valentines-Christchurch_Canterbury_Region_South_Island.html,"Christchurch, New Zealand",restaurants,5.0,3.0
Wonderful,"Brilliant place to pay your respects to the many fallen men.
Be prepared for some tiring climbs if you visit some of the out of the way cemeteries, but most are easy to find with easy access.
Most difficult part of visiting is finding safe places to park if you have your own transport as the roads are not that wide with quite steep angled drop offs on both sides.

The aircraft A320.

On time departures both sectors with on time arrivals.
Check in staff at both airports FANTASTIC. they could not have been more helpful and pleasant.
Cabin crew on both directions wonderful, cheerful, smiling and polite.
I did however feel sorry for them with a full passenger load in both directions and such a short flight time to deliver a very nice toasted Ham & Cheese sandwich then clean up before the approaches.
It was a credit to them how they coped.

Breath taking,"Probably the most peaceful place we have ever visited. The overwhelming feeling of peace is amazing, if only the rest of the world could feel this way.
The devastation here from the past ( for all sides concerned) is dreadful, but to come here and honour all these men (Husbands, fathers, sons, brothers) without dwelling on the circumstances is something very special.
The way in which the many cemeteries are kept is a credit to those concerned.
While there is nothing we could complain/moan about, our only disappointment was the extremely large lack of memorabilia related to our New Zealand participation.

A breath of fresh air,"To find a hotel that puts a smile on your face is a rare thing in this day and age.
TJ and his staff have made our 4 week holiday a time to remember.
They are more than staff, they make you feel like a family.
Their interaction with visitors is overwhelming, they care but more than that it is genuine.
No Kiwi or Ozzie should go past staying at TJs Hotel when visiting Galipolli.
Inside the hotel you find many historic books and guides for the battlefields & cemeteries along with pictures and memorabilia from that great war.
If you can't find a certain place just ask TJ. If he doesn't know it's location it doesn't igsist.
Look no further for somewhere to stay in Eceabat, you have found it.

Nice,"Loads of people, quite a long queue and waiting time to get into the Mosque.
Under renovations at this time but a beautiful and very peaceful place to visit.
For the Mosque my biggest concern was the lack of respect by the tourist public walking amongst those praying on the prayer floor and taking photos of the woman praying in the woman's area. Highly disrespectful I thought.

beware outside the Mosque are nice gentlemen who want to help and guide you through the entry process but only for you to emerge and there they are waiting for you enticing you to visit family stores nearby. Saying no seems to have no effect and you could feel highly pressured but turn a deaf ear and walk briskly toward a large group of people (even if you don't know them) and these creeps will then back away.

Take care!

Worth It,"With the history associated with the island this is a must do.
Enjoyable short boat ride, approx 20mins.
The booking process is very easy but make sure you get there early in the morning to avoid the queues should you decide to go in the morning, the office opens at 8.30am.
The castle itself is fascinating.
History beyond the book and movie is unreal.
Be prepared for a couple of narrow stair wells, other than that easy to get around.
Great 360 degree views around the island and of Marseilles and it's coastline.
Nice little cafe and VERY clean rest rooms.
NOTE; please ensure you are ready to get off quickly at Chateau d'if as the boat ties up very fast and departs just as quick it doesn't hang around.

Cabin crew below average.
Plane-long haul legs AKL-HKG-AKL, A330. Showing their age very worn and both aircraft uncomfortable.
Meals again below average.
Short haul HKG-BKK-HKG again A330's in domestic layout and very untidy with wear and tear age related again very uncomfortable.
Meals, well no comment.
Cabin crew on all four sectors were well below average. No caring,no smiles, no general courtesy, more like a burden.
In fact the return long haul leg HKG-AKL the crew were not seen after collecting meal trays until 3 hours out of Auckland all looking remarkedly refreshed.
The so called breakfast was served at this time (strange) when arrival at Auckland was 3.15pm, but to mention breakfast, the scrambled egg was so watery it was unable to be picked up by fork if you could catch it that is.

Definitely an airline I would never recommend to anyone regardless of price. Pay the difference and fly Singapore or Thai where you get a wonderful experience.
