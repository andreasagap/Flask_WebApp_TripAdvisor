Name says it all!,Yummy! Delicious ice cream- very reasonable prices! Was behind a crazy customer claiming her cone did not have as much ice cream as her husbands (looked big and half eaten to me).

Miss the old fish fry,Used to be the best fish fry in WNY. And the best mac and cheese. Not anymore. Food has gotten greasy. Service is ok- friendly. Usually Smokey is sitting at the bar. Seems like they gave up trying to be any good. Too bad-because they were excellent.,August 2020,Smokey's Bar & Grill,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g47967-d904113-Reviews-Smokey_s_Bar_Grill-Java_Center_New_York.html,"Java Center, New York",restaurants,2.0,3.5
Just ok,We went because our trip to Ireland we had planned for three years to celebrate our sons birthday and HS graduation was cancelled with COVID. So we went there. The shepherds pie was ok. Sat us in front of the check in podium. And zero acknowledgement of my son. Not that I was expecting a free dinner or anything- but a happy birthday would have been nice. Yes- they were well aware of it. Just piled on our disappointment from the beginning. So ok food- kinda crappy service.,July 2020,The Irishman,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g47619-d17748428-Reviews-The_Irishman-East_Aurora_New_York.html,"East Aurora, New York",restaurants,3.0,4.0

Great food but long wait,Food is great! But I wish they took reservations for small groups/couples all the time and not just during COVID.

Expensive,"Expensive and not impressive. Breakfast was not included and was a fortune. There was a big red stain on our carpet.

Slow and Not all that good,Super slow (we did have a large party however). The food was just ok. Two friends had pizza- that was good. I had the gluten free pizza- that was as good as you would expect. Three got sandwiches which they were disappointed in. They were not good (especially the cuban). I am not a beer drinker- but they seemed to enjoy the beer.,November 2019,TrAils to Ales Brewery,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g52677-d14173555-Reviews-TrAils_to_Ales_Brewery-Franklin_Pennsylvania.html,"Franklin, Pennsylvania",restaurants,3.0,4.5

Hope you like mustard,"Very nice people. Our waitress was super friendly. It is overpriced for BBQ. And super mustardy. I like mustard- my family does not. Their BBQ sauce tasted like it was 90% mustard, It is even yellow. We split the big platters- got two of them for the four of us. But with two drinks it was still $100.

Small,Cute little park. Small crisscrossing trails. Even my Eagle Scout got turned around a bit. Nice short walks. Some are a bit rocky and steep- but not too bad. It was a fun little diversion.

Very nice and Friendly,The front desk ladies were wonderful! Very friendly and welcoming. Made me feel like their guest- not just a customer. They could not accommodate our request for a roll away bed- so upgraded us to a suite at no additional cost. That was nice. We should have booked a suite initially. Only issue was we had spilled something on our carpet by accident. I cleaned up what I could with my hands but could not get it all so I stopped our housekeeper in the hall two doors up and asked her to take care of it. She did not. It was still there and got tracked around the room. Not sure how she made the beds and replaced our towels without vacuuming. Makes you wonder how clean the rooms actually are.,July 2019,La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Plattsburgh,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g48411-d236425-Reviews-La_Quinta_Inn_Suites_by_Wyndham_Plattsburgh-Plattsburgh_New_York.html,"Plattsburgh, New York",hotels,4.0,4.0
Old and Musty,"Very dated. The front lobby had decorations from every holiday up collecting dust. Easter, Christmas, Fall foliage, Fourth of July, etc.. Our room was far to walk- and hotel seemed empty. It was beyond musty- I was gagging on the smell. Had to open a window to get it out. The door stuck really bad- we had to slam it to close it. The breakfast was sad and small. Would not stay here again. Of course, Watertown does not seem to have many to offer and this was the last hotel on our trip to Plattsburgh. Pets are allowed- that was nice. Not that we brought ours.",July 2019,Travelodge by Wyndham Watertown,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g48812-d1177421-Reviews-Travelodge_by_Wyndham_Watertown-Watertown_New_York.html,"Watertown, New York",hotels,3.0,3.5
Nothing to do here in port,We wasted one of our days in Greece here. We drove in late the night before and returned our rental car. But could not get a ferry until dinner time the next day. Lots of seafood restaurants. All overpriced it seemed. Nothing to do but day trips to Athens and we did not want to chance traffic and missing our ferry. We should have booked our ferry way in advance- as it was Easter week in Greece and the ferries were full.,April 2019,Port of Piraeus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189403-d7974687-Reviews-Port_of_Piraeus-Piraeus_Piraeus_Region_Attica.html,"Piraeus, Greece",attractions,2.0,3.5
Pricey and just ok,Our most expensive meal in Greece. We were persuaded to try their $70 fish after being assured it tasted like lobster. It did not. The texture was soft and it was just not good. Our waiter felt bad and brought us a different fish at no cost- but they still charged us the $70 fish we did not eat. The salad and appetizers were good. The waiter was very attentive.,April 2019,To Pirofani tou Peiraia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189403-d10730612-Reviews-To_Pirofani_tou_Peiraia-Piraeus_Piraeus_Region_Attica.html,"Piraeus, Greece",restaurants,3.0,4.5
To Hydra and Back with no issues,"Clean and fast. A little confusing for us non-Greeks. Was chaos pushing to get on. Confused me when we finally did get on to learn we had assigned seats. My husband and myself and our two teens- three near each other- one on the other side of the boat. We had pre-bought our tickets on line weeks prior, then brought the email to the kiosk to get our paper tickets. Not sure at what point we were assigned our seats. People are nice and offered to move for us to sit together. Seats way more comfortable than Air Canada Rouge seats were...

Average Hotel with Great View,"We had our two teens with us. They gave us the honeymoon suite with two folding beds. Entire room smelled like cigarette smoke. Only time in Greece I encountered this. The view was nice. The staff was fantastic. They brought us cold juice complementary when we checked in. It was delicious after a long drive there. The clerk was friendly and helpful. He sent us to a restaurant he knew ""20 minute walk"". After half an hour we gave up and just picked a restaurant. They watched our bags when we checked out as we had a long wait for our ferry. And called a taxi for us, even helping us into the taxi.

Never Again,"The crew was wonderful. The pilots were great. The seats were torture. Thin, small and cramped. They barely reclined. This was a long flight in extremely uncomfortable seats. The food was completely gross. I had the gluten free option. My family the regular. Both were not good. The entire flight back from Athens the wifi did not work so we had no movies to watch.

Great location and great food,Stayed at a BNB right behind them. So the location was not only beautiful but also convenient. As with almost everywhere we ate in Greece the food was delicious. Waiters a little faster than average- but in Greece they are all slow by American standards. Not complaining- just letting you know that dinner is a slow event. Smoking is all around you- impossible to escape- but the Greek cigarettes are not as stinky as American ones. Had pizza the first night and Greek food for lunch the next day.

Crowded,Nice museum. We were there in April- not too hot out- comfortable in short sleeves and jeans. Roasting hot and crowded in museum. Interesting and well laid out.

Worth the drive from Athens!,We were driving from Athens to Meteora and decided to break it up with a stop here. So glad we did. It was beautiful. It helped we had watched a Rick Steves show on it just before coming to Greece- and I googled a map of the Oracle so that I knew where she sat (over the square hole by the ramp). It was a long climb to the stadium- my family went up without me and I stayed at the theater.

Disappointing,Such a cute little town- a cute square with a few restaurants to choose from. We chose wrong. Our waiter was filthy. Not just food dirty. I think the owner was the one who took our order- he spoke little English- but more than I spoke Greek so still impressive. Food was just okay. In a country of such delicious food it was disappointing.,April 2019,Nikos Taverna,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g2539298-d7374436-Reviews-Nikos_Taverna-Eptalofos_Phocis_Region_Central_Greece.html,"Eptalofos, Greece",restaurants,2.0,3.0
Nice hotel- lovely hostess!,The hotel was nice. Hard to find- we had a local bring us up to it. Could have been a bad GPS coordinate. Easy walk into town for dinner. 40 minutes from Delphi- that was a surprise. But town is gorgeous- glad we had this little detour. Asimina is gracious and kind- a wonderful hostess. Our beds were very very hard- but that seems to be the norm throughout Greece. The breakfast was good.,April 2019,Asimina Guesthouse,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g2539298-d3564149-Reviews-Asimina_Guesthouse-Eptalofos_Phocis_Region_Central_Greece.html,"Eptalofos, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.5
Overpriced but good,You are paying for the view and for being close to the Acropolis. Our meal was good. Can't say we had a bad meal in all of Greece. Don't remember specifically what we ate- but typically I had a lettuce based salad and my family had chicken souvlaki of some sort. Waiters were a little aggressive trying to pull you into the restaurant. But competition is fierce on this street and most are out trying to talk you into coming in. A polite and firm no suffices to have them move on to the next tourist.,April 2019,Ambrosia - The Refreshment Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d10510516-Reviews-Ambrosia_The_Refreshment_Bar-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,4.0,3.5

Wonderful,"We spent hours wandering the streets here. The shops are amazing! We did shop around- some shops are almost twice the price of others. For little things that is not too bad and maybe not worth the walk- but my son bought a chess set and that was definitely worth pricing.

Good,My meal (lobster risotto) was amazing! As were our margaritas. The rest of my party had marginal meals. My son had the lasagna- even as a teenage boy he thought it was just ok. My husband had the shrimp marinara and said it was not good. My daughter like her chicken parm- she had not eaten all day and was hungry.

Not well marked,It is huge. There were two competitions going on at the same time- cheer and dance. The only way to get to the schedule was to download it off a QR code. And then you had to know what hall you were in to see the schedule. The whole purpose is to see what hall you are in. Half our group missed day 1 performance because they were in ballroom C instead of hall C. Seems like some simple maps or even labeling the rooms would prevent that. Or just post that days schedule outside the room.

Have paid much less for much nicer,"We had a king suite. The air conditioner in the living room area was broken. The pull out bed had no sheets or pillow cases. We called down and someone brought up one sheet (still no fitted sheet) and a pillow. Still no pillow cases for two of our pillows. Since we had a suite, the cheerleaders got ready in our room. Leaving garbage on the floor and makeup all over the counter. I picked up what I could before we left for the competition. When we got back, still garbage on the floor and makeup all over the counter. And a note from housekeeping that she ran out of clean towels but we could get them from the front desk if we wanted. The toilet is way too close to the shower. You have to stand on it to get to the shower to turn it on. When the towels were on the bar of the shower they hung onto the toilet. Kinda gross.
The hallway was roasting hot. There was only one working elevator. The floor in the restaurant was so sticky both mornings I thought my shoe would get stuck. Tables were dirty.

Disappointed,We stay here every year. It is affordable and clean. This year our room leaked. It was raining and was coming in the room. After being on hold for over 20 minutes we packed up and went down to the lobby. They “upgraded” us to a newer room and gave us a free buffet to apologize. The new room is worse than the older ones.

Was okay,Just okay. Expensive. I got a can of wine- was $10! shocked by that... My chicken and rice dinner was dry. Veggies were soggy. Totally not worth the price. The people at the counter were exceptionally friendly and nice.,August 2018,Base Camp Eatery,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g61000-d13854384-Reviews-Base_Camp_Eatery-Yosemite_National_Park_California.html,"Yosemite National Park, California",restaurants,3.0,3.0
Was okay- the bees were terrible,"Food was just okay. Husband and kids got fried chicken. My burger was ok- just a burger. The house wine was good. So was the local beer. The bees outside were ridiculous. They really should take care of that. We and another table moved inside. Also, one of the waitresses would take smoke breaks on back patio. That is not cool. No matter where we sat we had cigarette smoke to smell. Not what you want when you are enjoying a pretty view of the river.",August 2018,River View Restaurant & Lounge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60963-d1126647-Reviews-River_View_Restaurant_Lounge-Three_Rivers_California.html,"Three Rivers, California",restaurants,3.0,3.5
Second time not as good. Go during the week- cook was better,We first went during the week for breakfast. It was amazing. Lots of hash browns. Coffee good. Eggs good. Pancakes good. Bacon undercooked- maybe some people like it that way. Went back on a saturday morning. Small scoop of has browns (half of previous visit). We asked for crispy bacon and got almost burnt dried out bacon (surely there is a middle ground). Still a beautiful view. We enjoyed watching the ducks.,August 2018,The Gateway Restaurant & Lodge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60963-d550564-Reviews-The_Gateway_Restaurant_Lodge-Three_Rivers_California.html,"Three Rivers, California",restaurants,4.0,3.5
Just wow,"Wow, Words cannot describe it. Pictures do not do it justice. Until you see them you just don't understand. Go see these magnificent trees. Absolutely no wifi or cell coverage. Enjoy the unplugging.",August 2018,Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60963-d9559894-Reviews-Sequoia_and_Kings_Canyon_National_Parks-Three_Rivers_California.html,"Three Rivers, California",attractions,5.0,5.0
Rushed us,They rushed us through the first day we stopped. There was construction on the road and they said we had to leave right then to get through. So we ran off. Did not need to rush. They let you through every 20 minutes or so. If you hit it wrong you are going to wait 20 minutes. No big deal. Second day we stayed and talked to them. They gave good information.,August 2018,Lodgepole Visitor Center,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g143050-d10763512-Reviews-Lodgepole_Visitor_Center-Sequoia_and_Kings_Canyon_National_Park_California.html,"Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park, California",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Wow (again),You have to see this tree. It is the biggest in the world. Not the tallest- biggest. The walk is all downhill so then all uphill back. We parked at the top and walked down to it. Then I sat at the bottom at the handicap lot and my family picked me up on the way out. Again- no wifi or cell phone signal. Enjoy the moment.,August 2018,General Sherman Tree,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g143050-d146450-Reviews-General_Sherman_Tree-Sequoia_and_Kings_Canyon_National_Park_California.html,"Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park, California",attractions,5.0,4.5
This was dumb,I think they are just trying too hard to replace the tree you could drive through. Its a log. They cut a hole in it and you drive through it. The picture on this cuts off just before the top. Not worth it. The trees are worth the drive. Go around it- or through if you must. Then just enjoy the giant trees. Still no wifi or cell service. Enjoy the quiet.,August 2018,Tunnel Log,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g143050-d8535608-Reviews-Tunnel_Log-Sequoia_and_Kings_Canyon_National_Park_California.html,"Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park, California",attractions,3.0,4.0
