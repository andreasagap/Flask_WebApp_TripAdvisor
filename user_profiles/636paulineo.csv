Anglo Saxons to Christianity !,"A lovely church with such a great history. There is a splendid statue of St Aiden in the grounds.

Worth the hike up to the fort.,"Worth the hike up to the fort, interesting place to visit with majestic panoramic views of the surrounding countryside.

A must visit !,"A must visit if in the area, The Castle's 'Kings Hall' has the' WOW' factor. Such magnificent vistas towards the East coast. Walking along the ramparts was interesting, as a one way system was in place due to social distancing being adhered to. I should imagine when all the activities are up and running after the Covid19 restrictions are lifted, it is be a vibrant place to visit.

A worthwhile visit.,"This impressive 'created' garden is fabulous, ( I watched the short video film on the making of it).

An Inn with plenty of character and local characters.,"We stayed B&B for a week in Aug '20, and although we didn't intend to dine at the Inn each night, however after enjoying our first evening meal so much, we ate there every night during our stay.

A little show !,"There were only four of us in the audience, although it was the first performance of the day...later we saw a coach outside, probably adding to the whole ambience of the theatre. Of course there was the ubiquitous audience participation of dancing at the end ! The music and singing were all quite mesmerising ! The dancers flicking their hair was a lovely, although I did think they must get a head ache after each performance.

Our room was spacious with everything one might need for a luxurious overnight stay. The gardens are magnificent and the kitchen garden is well worth a visit. The lawns are a splendid place to sit back and relax with a glass or two of bubbly. I was rather disappointed in the breakfast the following morning; I chose the full English, hoping to have it presented and cooked in a novel way, but t wasn't; but I still enjoyed my stay at the manor.

Wonderful Lazy Days in Paradise.,"We stayed one of the water Bungalows with steps down to clear blue water with an abundance of different species of fish…amazing !
The accommodation was fantastic with everything a guest would need for a trouble free and restful holiday.
Snorkelling shoes are essential if you are staying in a water bungalow, so buy some before you go; hiring of other snorkelling gear is free; just ensure the dive shop is open before walking along the full length of the pier…we walked along in the mid-day sun to find it closed. Usage of WiFi in the bungalow was free, although the paperwork stated $18 for four days, we were inclusive and so was the WiFi…only one person at any one time, so you do have to keep logging in and out and remembering the password, but overall the reception was better than I get at home.
The service was superb, our bungalow was kept pristine by Mauroof , he was a delight to chat to and very knowledgeable about the resort and the neighbouring islands. Our restaurant waiter was Nasraf, a young gentleman with polite manners and very courteous towards us each meal time.
Covers on the dining room chairs would have helped me, especially when the backs of my legs got sunburnt from snorkelling…so be careful and cover up even while in the water.
I mentioned the dining room chairs in their questionnaire, but seeing as the whole resort is due to be extended and refurbished in April ’18, I’m sure they’ll eradicated all the little niggles. We took our own rain coats as it was coming to the end of the rainy season, only to find they were already supplied, along with life jackets, dressing gowns, slippers etc. …The water bungalows roofing material does dramatically amplify the sound of the rain.
The food in the restaurant was 1st Class, I’m sure it would warrant a couple of stars from that Roly Poly tyre man called Michelin. Finally I must mention the pastry chef I don’t have a sweet tooth but the desserts on offer were divine…SHUKURIA (Thank you) to all the attentive staff for a lovely holiday.",November 2017,Cinnamon Hakuraa Huraa Maldives,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g6695197-d647964-Reviews-Cinnamon_Hakuraa_Huraa_Maldives-Hakuraa_Island.html,Hakuraa Island,hotels,5.0,4.5
Authentic Polish Cuisine,"As we passed by we saw locals sitting enjoying the food at this super little café. They have an English menu, but you have to ask for it at the counter. The food is basic but delicious and ‘cheap as chips’.
The copious amount of meat pierogi was so very tasty, much better than ones I later tried in a hotel nearby. We tried to go the following day, but every table was taken by a local resident. Well worth a visit and I think just as inexpensive as the infamous ‘milk bars’.",March 2017,Bar Smak,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g274772-d2252641-Reviews-Bar_Smak-Krakow_Lesser_Poland_Province_Southern_Poland.html,"Krakow, Poland",restaurants,5.0,4.5

Enjoy some pampering by having a great massage (cash only) in a purpose built building.The views of the surrounding area from the lounge is magnificent. The hotel seems to be cut into the actual rock face. There were many steep steps, so after dark ensure you have a torch with you and watch your footing. Wonderful free tasty bar snacks with you pre-dinner drinks, alcoholic drinks from the bar were a little more expensive then we'd been used to paying, but this hotel is classed as POSH.

An Ideal stop over before travelling down the coast.,"This hotel is made up of small cottages set around a very nice pool with good air conditioning in each room. The eye for detail in the service was really good. The hotel has it's own Pizza oven, so do try their pizza, they really are superb. It was a Sunday when we arrived and there were many children in the pool, so obviously popular by the locals. The precision in the serving of the food by a 'nod' from the head waiter was very impressive, one hand behind the back while serving the dish ! You can pay in Euros here.

A wrap around wall acts as the door for the flush toilet and wash room, we were provided with large buckets of water and small jugs...

A pleasant overnight stay in a decent hotel..,"This hotel is located on one of the main thoroughfare; the only snag is the locals start to gather outside the main gate at breakfast time selling their wares. It is handy for the short walk to the main Post Office to send off those ubiquitous picture post cards back home. It is in a prime location for the Pousse Pousse chappies to gather and collect a fare, which can be fun, however ensure you book them first and negotiate a price. It is ideally located for a trip to the sacred Lake Tritriva. There is a very pretty garden at the side of the hotel and we picnicked there before setting off on the next leg of our journey. When we first arrived we found many mosquitos in our room, so make sure plenty of repellent is on hand, although they did provide nets.

A Fairly Modern Hotel,"Our room was specious with all we required for a two night stay, the hotel is ideally located for the Rainforest Park. There is Modern shower room, however the shower room and modern toilet was not fully ‘closed in’ at the top of the dividing wall, not good if you and your travelling companion are not on very good terms. There were many mosquitos in the room on arrival, the room had an electric fan but the electricity supply was intermittent. An unusual mozzie net rolled up over the head of the bed. There is no safe in the room and we were advised to take all our valuables with us at all times.

We stayed here for two nights before and two nights after our travels down through this amazing country. Both the rooms we stayed in were split level and were located within a private walled enclosure surrounded by mature woodland. There was air-conditioning which made for a great nights sleep; however if in doubt from those pesky little critters, ensure you have your own mosquito net ready; there wasn't one supplied in any of the rooms.
There is a spacious reception and also outside dining area. Complimentary dips/biscuits in the bar with your pre-dinner drinks. Fresh bread rolls and omelettes are on offer at breakfast.

Early morning bird watching is a must from here, it is quite a busy hotel with many 'changeovers', Ensure you have a good torch handy as it's pretty dark even during the day in the room.
