Moderate hotel,"First time visited the village and i get surprised by the sea view. We like very much the swimming pool area, especially the kids and that outside of the room is full of grass and they could play. We got halfboard and the buffet was good enough, so as the drinks from pool bar. The drinks prices were very reasonables. The best in the hotel was the behavior and the kindness of all the staff. The only negative is that the room are not very clean, full of insects and some furniture needs to change.",August 2020,Akamanthea Holiday Village,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g190388-d1007637-Reviews-Akamanthea_Holiday_Village-Polis_Paphos_District.html,"Polis, Cyprus",hotels,3.0,3.5

Bad service,We visited the restaurant few days ago. We order 3 steaks and one Burger. They brought the steaks and after half hour the Burger didn't Come. We ask for it and they brought after 40 min. We asked them for ketchup 3 times and because they didn't bring we borrow one from the next table. The same with beers... wait for them for over 30min even we 've told the waiter twice. Asking the waiter why is that happening he answer us that they are only 2 waiters for 70 persons...so bad servise,August 2020,Tis Pizza's Mezeklikia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g2667232-d10747446-Reviews-Tis_Pizza_s_Mezeklikia-Prodromi_Paphos_District.html,"Prodromi, Cyprus",restaurants,2.0,4.5

New one,"We visited Platres to stay just for one night. They were only 2 restaurants open for the night so we decided to try this one. We went at early evening so we sit next to the log fire. The decor inside is not very good. We had a mixed local starters for two, mexican burger, pork steak, spagghetti bolognese and two kids pasta. Everything was excellent and fresh from the salad, the meat and.....the chips. No frozen chips for sure.The kids pasta were as big as the adults one. The portions are big enough for sure. The prices are reasonable and the owner gave us the drinks for free (no alcoohol). They also had cartoon on tv and that was the best for kids.

Still worth it!,"That was the 4rth time that i visited the museum and is still nice experience when you visit London. For 1st time i visited the museum with kids but they also love the experience. Remember to stand in line in cloakroom first and leave there your staff, even the jackets. If you have stroller they keep it there for free. We stand the line for about 10-15 min and after we get in. From the beggining we bought the 30p package to have all our photos digital. The musseum every time is full but you can see and photo any figure you want, that was never problem for me. The kids love the avengers area and of course Star wars is amazing. The only negative for me is that the most photos we had digital are not good. The photographers of the museum tooks a photos and not check if is good or not. We stand for 30 min. at queue to get photographed with ""The Rock"" and the staff didn't even told us to hold up the kids and they dont feet in the photo because the photocamera is on the ceiling. very disappointed with their photos but ok general we have fun and like it as always.",December 2019,"Magical London Pass Including Madame Tussauds London, The London Eye, SEA LIFE London, The London Dungeon and Shrek’s Adventure!

Visit it for sure!,I visited the museum with my two kids and adore it. The exhibitions inside are amazing especially the dinosaur and zoo area. The blue whale skeleton is amazing and also like that they have a lot of dinosaur skeleton hanging from ceiling. Visit it especially with kids they have a lot to learn.

Nice location,"The rooms as the whole hotel is clean and tidy. Comfortable bed, flat tv, safe box. The staff was polite and very helpfull. The waitress staff on the rooftop restaurant was very friendly. The breakfast is buffet with basic food but you can choose from their menu to order fried eggs, bacon, scrabble eggs, omelette, etc. Love the scrabble eggs with feta! It was so delicious! The best is hotel location. You can walk from there all over the city. Monastiraki and Psyrris squares are a few minutes distance from there. However, you can also take the metro which is very close if you want to and get in mind that one of the Metro entries is on Athinas street. The only negative is that the hotel has only stairs and not elevator and if you cannot walk stairs you can't stay here, have in mind that the breakfast areas is on 4rth floor.
