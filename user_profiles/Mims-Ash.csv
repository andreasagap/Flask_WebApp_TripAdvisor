"Instagrammable, Panoramic Spot!","Must go at least once in your lifetime. Beautiful scenic drive along this road which leads to Lord Arch Gorge and 12 Apostles.

For those who do not drive and do not wish to be on the big bus tours, there are travel agents who cater for transport in smaller vehicles such as mpv or van which proves to be more exclusive for the family.

My family and I engaged a similar tour and travelled on an mpv for the 6 of us comfortably without having to wait for the other tourists such as those big bus tour operators. Choice is yours though .",December 2019,The Great Ocean Road,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g261667-d4092377-Reviews-The_Great_Ocean_Road-Torquay_Victoria.html,"Torquay, Australia",attractions,5.0,4.5
A laidback and enjoyable stay for 3 generations,"We came in for 3D2N as 6 pax with oldeat being 67 year old and youngest being 13.

Everyone is still talking about the enjoyable time we had in the Lavender Cottage. The property had no wifi but had all the activities that a modern country lack of. Coming from Singapore, we are always into farmstays and have done such stays in other countries too. This, by far has superseded any other experiences that we have had. The tractor ride on Sunday morning at 9 am sharp was informative. Bicycles were provided for guests to roam around the property and feed the animals anytimes they like with available fruits and vegetables. It was a definitely therapeutic experience for us. As the cottages are self-catering, we made it a point to load ourselves with food and groceries prior to the stay so we do not need to be making trips out unnecessarily. Understand that there are nearby shops too within 10-15 mins drive, if you so wish to dine out.

Dont forget to collect fresh farm eggs (available daily) when you are there. Most importantly, take a back seat and enjoy the view, the pace and the vicinity full of farm animals, kangaroos even their pet kangaroo roaming around the main house!",December 2019,Freshwater Creek Cottages,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g261667-d4176428-Reviews-Freshwater_Creek_Cottages-Torquay_Victoria.html,"Torquay, Australia",hotels,5.0,5.0
Sep is still hot!!!,"Get the €30 tickets where you can explore over 5 days several ruins applicable under this ticket - all of which within the vicinity.

Just be prepared to do alot of walking, hiking and climbing though. Wear reasonable walking shoes as the stones leading to the area gets slippery even when its not wet.

When we there on 14 Sep, it was pretty scorching hot but windy. The kind of wind that will blow away not just hats and caps, tourists inclusive . Quite a number of tourists slipped and fell. We did too while trying to cross to another spot.

Reminder not to climb onto any part of the ruins as this is not allowed supposedly to continue with preservation efforts which is understandable of course. There will be staffs roaming to ensure and tell u to refrain from doing so, using their whistle on hand.

1. Quiet environment unlike the touristy places in Oia
2. Excellent seafood at a fraction of the price compared to Oia and the other parts of santorini

Amazing time : UP CLOSE & PERSONAL,"Omg...we had such fabulous time especially with the proximity of the animals in their natural habitat.

Money flow like water in Watertown...Great buys!,"The place was located pretty near northbridge area on James St where we stayed. It took us 15-20 mins walk which we did our last day in Perth and shopping was never enough. Here, tons of shops on clearance. So, you guessed it right! We never had enough despite spending half a day here. Everythimg seemed to be on sale..sale..SALE. Seriously! We could have spent our fortune here simply because its almost dirt cheap but the buys were simply great.

Factorie, Puma, Cotton On, Esprit, Dotti...in and out we go for comfortable wear selling as cheap as $2-$5 for spag top and bermz to relatively $14.90 -19.90 only for gorgeous blouses and pants!

For thw family members who are not fazed by shopping, there are starbucks or was it coffeebean and some cafes around. For Muslims, there is a Turkish cafe in the middle section of the shopping outlet. Anyways, in and out we go with a shopping spree but eventually with a heavy we left, not able to cover the humongous area after much exploring.

A Holiday Rental and Attraction ALL-IN-ONE!!!,"From start to end, Katherine who fronted the reservations was so helpful, friendly and informative.

It began with our query to get to Lavendale Farm (1.5 hours from Perth Airport) over June 15 holidays given that we are not driving. Initially, Katherine did offer to fetch us from the train station in Midland. However, she shared that she was unable to arrange pick up as our group was a big one. Still, Katherine did not process our deposit for fearing that our transport may be an issue for us. Eventually, it was also her who managed to arranged a transport company to fetch us from the Airport and to proceed to Belmont to purchase groceries since Lavendale is self-contained and we needed halal sources. That came as a SUR PLUS for us and wonderful gesture from the host side.

When we arrived, we were greeted by the lovely Katherine and was led to the our Aussie Bush Cabin. This was meant for 5 pax but Katherine arranged for an extra bed to accommodate all 6 of us in the conducive yet peaceful chalet. We were allowed to check-in as soon as we arrived. Once we were settled, we then went to head down to the farm area to witness and experience the feeding session. The kids totally enjoyed the personal experience.

The days that followed, we were kept occupied with other activities such foosball, table tennis and such in the entertainment shed. The bbq pit within the chalet grounds was great for bonding. The most rewarding experience was to light the fireplace maually with cut up logs and branches provided to us daily. As it was winter, it was crucial to maintain the heat so as to last us til morning considering that noght there can be freezing!!!

In the morning, we made another trip to the farm for unofficial feeding of the farm animals. There, it was Katherine's husband, Merv, who shared with us alot of useful information pertaining to the animals. We even went with him on his rounds to do his daily chores and boy, that was an eye-opener!

Totally will return as this has been a wonderful experience for us all. We wish the couple and their farm all the best in their future undertaking. Thank you for the fantastic experience and been such great hosts to us!",June 2015,Lavendale Farm,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g495089-d1389634-Reviews-Lavendale_Farm-York_Avon_Valley_Western_Australia.html,"York, Australia",hotels,5.0,4.5
Soak in the Sights only,"The market may be overrated as the wares sold are basically the typical wet market and normal home wares. Although there are aboriginal artifacts sold, the other items are pretty normal finds. We ended up buying cupcakes and milk shakes while we sat to enjoy them in a nice artistic corner coupled with the fact that there were busking activities to entertain us.

For souvenirs, best to head to E-Shed instead. Nothing much to see in Fremantle Market and you may want to give it a miss if strapped for time.

"An Insight of the Not so Pleasant history but a rewarding experience, no doubt","When my family insisted to pop by the Fremantle Prison after a visit to the Market, I was pretty skeptic much. Given the slightly disappointing experience with the former visit, I had not expected much from this other attraction.

We bought the extended ticket which entailed covering another route including the premises of the women's prison. The guided tours proved to be amazing as it was done with much humour and attentiveness to questions posed by the group. The group was small albeit inquisitive and we all were very keen to find out more and more as we went further an further into the prison. The guide got us to re-enact in some situation which proved to be entertaining at times.

Some of the stories were heartwrenching. Others were gruesome account of the crimes committed by the well-known prisoners. A totally amazingly historical place to be at. Worth every penny spent on the tickets. Totally recommended for all to visit. A must-not miss attraction when you are in Fremantle.",June 2015,Fremantle Prison,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g285726-d319394-Reviews-Fremantle_Prison-Fremantle_Greater_Perth_Western_Australia.html,"Fremantle, Australia",attractions,5.0,4.5
Fish Chips and Seafood Salad to rave for,"After much walking in Fremantle Market and Prison and after some souvenir shopping in E-Shed, don't forget to drop by the harbour area for some fresh fish and chips.

Superb Service by Grant,"Full day tour including Caversham, Lobster Shack, Pinnacles and Lancelin.

Kudos to Grant for being such a wonderful and engaging tour guide. He is so customer-oriented and extremely friendly compared to his colleague who attended to us at Lancelin while we did the sandboarding activity. The latter was edgy and appeared to be less patient with our group. Would be uncalled for given that he should be more customer service oriented in this business.

Nevertheless, we were so lucky to have been with Grant alll the way til the last stop where he went out of his way to alight us closest to our apartment. We want to commend him for his attaitude and nice gesture besides his earnest disposition when helping and attending to the tour group.

Hope his hard work is recognised by the Company!!!

Home away from home in Northbridge,"Our family stayed from 6 - 9 June 15 and generally enjoyed our stay here. Shannon was an angel and helped address most of our queries.

Location was one of the pluses as we were close to most things like eateries, abit of a walk to Chinatown and a nice little park as well. CAT Blue Bus was within walking distance too.

The only 3 negative issues we had were as follows:

1. That the 3 bedroom apartment were also 3 stories high. My aged mother had to climb up and down the stairs to get from the bedroom to kitchen or from living room on the middle floor to the toilet - the washroom and shower were only available on the ground floor. This also means that the 2 persons sleeping on single beds on the highest floor would have to climb down 2 sets of stairs to use the bathroom. Maybe the fact that this was 3 storeys should be communicated in the website to alert customers who travel with old folks like us. The children were simply loving it on the contrary, though

2. The other set back was the wifi. Jennifer who claimed to be the manager, was confidently saying that the property was charging more than $5 per 24 hours prior to our stay and that the policy has recently been changed, other hotel and properties are providing unlimited wifi. Especially in our situation where there are 6 of us and the free wifi were extended to 3 gadgets at any one time only. The same rule applies to any other apartment size with less occupants. Eg. a one bedded apartment in the property are allowed the same 3 log ins as a 3 bedded one whereas the latter has more occupants than the former booked. Just to feedback that this should be looked into as it does not seemed feasible for us who pay more for the apartment and given the same rights as someone who are paying less.

3. We thought that Jennifer was not as customer oriented as Shannon was too. Many a time she confused herself while clarifying and end up confusing us in the process. When we first enquired over the counter on the wifi, she did not even bother to check as to how much an extra log in would cost and after her much assuming as well our probing, she only relented to get up from her seat to reach for a file. We thought that was a turn off from a customer point of view especially when she appeared irritated when asked to check on it. Slamming the black file on the counter top was just unacceptable so we disliked asking her any further questions when she was at the counter. If she is really the manager, she should certainly be more professional than that!

As a whole, our stay was pleasant minus these little setback. The apartment was clean and definitely spacious. Great location. Owner offered us lemons before we left for the airport and boy, huge lemon trees they they have within the property and he allowed you to pick any humongous ones you desired with the help of his friendly kenyan-looking staff. Nice chap there. Lastly, the property was a short 30 mins ride to the international airport. Will we stay again? For those positive experiences mentioned, yes...we might return!",June 2015,Best Western Northbridge Apartments,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g255103-d256470-Reviews-Best_Western_Northbridge_Apartments-Perth_Greater_Perth_Western_Australia.html,"Perth, Australia",hotels,4.0,4.0
Short Staycation @ Superior Room,"It was a weekend where my husband had to work overnight around Orchard and after sourcing some hotels, we decided on staying here.

The room looks just ordinary for the price paid. We understand that location may be the reason for that. I must say location is superb within the vicinity of alot of eateries, cafes and restaurants for any travellers.

Wifi is great all the time and all day. Comfortable bed and the only 2 downsides were that we found the water pressure of the shower really lacking for a good old shower and the phone line to call local numbers does not work at all. It was a little exasperating when my husband and I needed to communicate constantly especially in a situation where my SIM card was faulty. I had to call the mobile operator(M1)thru hotel's telephone operator to gety mobile line sorted.

Overall not too bad stay.",May 2015,Rendezvous Hotel Singapore by Far East Hospitality,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g294265-d299606-Reviews-Rendezvous_Hotel_Singapore_by_Far_East_Hospitality-Singapore.html,"Singapore, Singapore",hotels,3.0,4.5
Overall good experience saved by the host,"In all fairness, it was a mixed feeling staying on the apartment especially with the equally mixed reviews. Whilst, the location was fantastic with just about everything and anything on the 1st storey, there were several things that would require loads of improvement too. To put it simply, i have listed the Pros & Cons based on my personal exp.

PROS :
1. Location, location and definitely, LOCATION. This screams fantastic for the shopping area just right on the first floor with big names such as Michael Kors, Givenchy, Adidas among others. Eateries everywhere and Chinese Muslim food jist across the small street. Departmental store called Wangfujing is connecfed to the residence apartment. Starbucks 2 mins walk. All of these simply within the vicinity.

2. WiFi was provided in the apartment although minimally utilised since Google & Facebook are not allowed in the country. Apps like instagram took awhile to load.

3. Spacious living enough for all 6 of us

4. Heater during winter. Apparently some hotels/apartment may not have it.

5. Great host! Qilian stood in for Rick who was away. She was there when you needed her & helped us alot by going out of her way when we sought her assistance in getting around kunming. Fantastic customer service. Friendly and wondeful. All of us were full of praises for her effort in making our stay as comfortable as possible.

6. Probably the only accommodation which provides FREE pick up from airport to town.

CONS:

1. Entrance to apartment was by going through a service balcony and boy, was it dirty and unkempt. There was a cleaning cart with broom, mop and cleaning items. Pails strewn at the sides and what seemingly appeared like a porcelain potty which clearly looked dirty.

2. Rude cleaning lady. We were told that she would come in daily and maybe a few times in the dsy despite our absenrlce because she places her cleaning cart inside the apartment! I have habit of cleaning the floor of every apartments ee stayed in but she did not change into slipper out of her boots and went arnd the house). The last straw with her bad attitude was when she placed a floor rag on the dining table where we placed our foodstuffs! She was told not to come in again til our last day there.

3. Faulty toilet bowl in the common toilet. One of my family members haf to take a dump yet it couldnt flush down the waste. We had to endure with the situation and the smell for the whole night and before we went off for the day. Qilisn was quick to resolve by calling the plumber tho.

4. Main door was with the pin lock. Didnt feel safe at night especiallu after cleaning lady episode. She knows the pin, btw. No safety felt.

5. Heater was not very strong esp the one in the master bedroom. Possibly too becos the room was massive. Cold room on most nights.

Again, this is really my 2.cents worth of contribution. For those considering to stay here, do weigh in all issues laid out and come to a decision then. Good luck!",December 2014,IC Holiday Shun Cheng Serviced Apartments,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g298558-d2136142-Reviews-IC_Holiday_Shun_Cheng_Serviced_Apartments-Kunming_Yunnan.html,"Kunming, China",hotels,3.0,4.0
Fuss-free but hell yeah with its location.,"We merely had a 1 night stay just for rest & relax purposes. Well, really a no fringe hotel and they don't have facilities besides the free WiFi. Breakfast provided is super simple and typically express. The likes of fried rice and noodle. There is no continental breakfast other than some toast and spread.  Well, if you don't have high expectations, this should do. Plus, there are food galore on the food street in the mall opposite.

Fantastic location, though. You can exit from the hotel, cross a small road and enter Nagoya Hill Mall by the side entrance of a shop called ACE hardware. Walk through that and you'd get to the heart of the mall in no time. 

Along the hotel, there is a newly opened massage spa called Reborn. Other than that, a family ktv is on its left upon exiting too. 

Overall, good stay but fuss-free...really. I would return for the strategic location.",October 2014,Amaris Hotel Nagoya Hill,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g2270770-d6402776-Reviews-Amaris_Hotel_Nagoya_Hill-Nagoya_Batam_Riau_Archipelago_Riau_Islands_Province.html,"Batam, Indonesia",hotels,4.0,3.5
Lovely Stay Marred by Staff Poor Standards,"I have booked the Bay Cliff after much thought and mixed reviews.

Pateera was very quick to respond to my request and acceded to complimentary upgrade and late check-out as we were celebrating our 10th Anniversary there which was communicated to him. While that sounded excellent to our ears, we were disappointed when we found it hard to locate the entrance especially when we arrived as late as 10.30 pm. The security officer was not that helpful to direct to the reception which took us a couple of lifts and many stairs.

What was worst, after a tiring trip, we were also made to climb what seemed more than 5 flight of stairs to reach the our upgraded apartment. However, upon entering, we were greeted by the cleanliness, modern concept and loads of space. This was a 2 beddded apartment complete with jacuzzi on the balcony facing seaview. Small but well equiped kitchenette which proved to be useful since there was no breakfast (typical though for apartments.

The pluses I can be sharing would be that the place was :
- quiet and peaceful for a retreat
- facing the sea and lush hillside while soaking in the bath
- lots of privacy
- clean and spacious
- modern concept and facilities
- near halal eateries just across the road leading to patong
- accessible to most attractions even The Upside Down House
- superb swimming pool all to ourselves mostly
- family-oriented vicinity

Overall, we (2 Adults and 2 kids) had a wonderful stay except for these few minuses

- Staff very nonchanlant to attend to pratically anything i.e. requests, questions etc
- not ideal for those with mobility problems, no lift to upper floors
- power and water went out for awhile when I was in the shower
- no towels at the pool area
- confusing for a first time visitor even getting to the reception on the mid floor.

Will I return again? Probably not, because the climbing of stairs caused my back problem after the trip. This should have been communciated to the guests prior to assigning of unit lest it cause inconvenience to them.",September 2014,The Bay Cliff,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297930-d1791970-Reviews-The_Bay_Cliff-Patong_Kathu_Phuket.html,"Phuket, Thailand",hotels,4.0,3.0
Cosy little Shabu Shabu Shop...& it's Halal!,"Its tucked in one corner off the road slightly and took us utilising GPS and a few rounds of questions before we found the location. Yes, it's not ideal nor is it prominent.

But if you do wonder whether it was worth going there, we were happy we didn't give it a miss! The people at the shop were warm and friendly while they tried their utmost to explain the different parts of the meat, shoulder, stomach etc. Given that their English were limited, they still made every effort with movements all possible to describe the source and varieties whilst promoting what we may like best.

Although a tad bit pricey for the available packages, its worth the experience and the warmth displayed. The only setback is the distance where the clay stove was placed which is too near the seating area. As we had young kids with us then and it was quite a challenge keeping them away. Plus, our inhaling the charcoal and fumes, while cooking didn't help make us feel any more uncomfortable.

Should the trip here be made at all, ask for the seats further in. It looks far more comfortable for sure. Have a go...have their shoulder shabu shabu..I am slurping as I reminisce the taste of the fresh meat in my mouth. Melts wonderfully...tasty definitely!",October 2013,Gyumon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1066456-d4667816-Reviews-Gyumon-Shibuya_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html,"Shibuya, Japan",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Just an average waterpark needing more maintenance :),"Given our young kids and after loads of walking, we thought it was a good idea to ""reward"" the kids with a visit here to soak for abit.

Much to our dismay, the waterpark was just so-so, not becos our expectations were higher (maybe a tad bit haha). The place looks like it hadn't been changed since 90s as the environment did look dated. In order to get to another slide attraction, you would have to climb a little bridge proved to be slippery when wet. There were instances that we witnessed some folks almost slipping and landing on their backs/heads.

Credits are given when it's due though, the staff's are really responsible and trustworthy.

When we kept our valuables in their locker, it was tied with a plastic bag and attached with a cable tie for a fee less than 50,000 I think. One of our bags was huge, so it didn't fit the plastic bag. When we returned, our items in the zippers were all intact. Makes us think that unlike other countries, our valuables were safe with the Vietnamese! How honest!

Another display of their pluses were their constant warnings given to the visitors. Small children of a certain height were always warned not to exceed some water height given despite being there with the parents. Places like their wave pool and most of their slides are guarded with really responsible folks. This is something commendable as we have been to other waterpark who cannot be the least bothered about visitors' safety although something unsafe happens right under their noses.

I won't recommend travelling 45 mins from town unless of course, if you would have loads of time to waste ;)u",June 2014,Dam Sen Water Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293925-d1178970-Reviews-Dam_Sen_Water_Park-Ho_Chi_Minh_City.html,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",attractions,3.0,4.0
Kids love it..We did too!,"This place evoked emotions even for the young.

The history was very well-depicted in the much debated photographs captured during the war and its aftermath. Gives some sense of self-realisation. Not much need to be said for their display of fighter planes & tanks. My 8 to kept repeating the word awesome wherever he went.

Amusing & keeps us constantly entertained,"After roaming and checking out museums on District 1, we headed to the theatre with the hopes of sitting through the entertainment. We hadn't opted for their dinner package as we (Muslims) are wary of the food served at buffet.

Need not book through agent cos you end up paying more of cos for their services. Just head down straight to purchase the tickets with shows from 530 pm to other latest slots.
The storyline may be difficult to understand at first but as we observed, it was great how they put it together.

One improvement would be if they could translate or did some introduction in English, it would be fab.

Mixed feeling leaving the hotel...last verdict? Rather disappointing,"The location was perfect for us given that halal food were everywhere on this Malaysian street. People outside the hotel like the iced coffee seller are very very friendly and sincere. I can never say the same for the hotel staffs.

They sulk when you come down at 9 am for breakfast cos it is up to 930 am. They sulk when you ask for half-boiled eggs for the kids. Not friendly at all most times. That includes the reception. Speaking of which, the staff manning the reception when checking in, would ask to keep 2 passports with them. DO NOT OBLIGE. We insisted that they do not retain and instead copy out manually the info needed since they have no copier machine.

Room is spacious with 2 doublebeds. Cable tv & WiFi is good. Door lock is normal key and noise can be heard easily from outside. Not so clean and needs a makeover lift too. Our experiences were were made worse with these episodes.

1) Staffs expected to be tipped constantly when they do things for you. Seems not dedicated and more tips motivated

2) Power trip causing the toilet light to blow out. With diarrhoea issue on hand that same night, it was horrible to be using the toilet in pitch dark at 2-3 am!

3) We were accused of eating a potato chip when we hadn't touched the basket full of what appeared as expired dusty items. travelling with kids, we never fail to bring our own snacks for them or buy from the supermarket right outside the hotel. Not to be bragging here but our snacks are far more premium than the one we were said to consume which we were told to pay for at checkout. We would gladly pay if we did consume it but we hadn't and was made to sign a declaration before leaving. Peeved at the commotion for the pathetic item in front of otherin guests. We strongly believe that it must be taken by their own staff while cleaning was done.

New Hotel & Superb Service,"The hotel , apparently, is newly built in 2013. Located in Little India of Malacca, you can find a row of indian shophouses selling prayer offerings and a whole orf other things like Indian crackers.

Anyhow, the hotel is relatively 10-15 mind walk away from the city centre : Jonker Walk, The Stadthuys, Menara Taming Sari etc. If you were to walk further, the shopping area such as Dataran Palawan Megamall & Mahkota Parade is within reach too.

The service of the hotel staffs were fabulous. It started off with the hotel manager, Mr Abu Dzarrin, who was very helpful, responsive and accommodating. We were originally asked to wire transfer the money since online booking options were still in progress. In the end, he very much obliged the booking despite our unable to process money transfer. Although, we made total payment at point of check-in, the trust he had was immensely appreciated.

When we arrived at the reception, the counter staff, Mr Ainol, was simply courteous and humorous at the same time. Check-in was a breeze and in no time, we were in our respective rooms. Rooms were spick and span. The extra mattresses came shortly too, delivered by a nice elderly housekeeping staff. The only minus here would be mattresses provide as extra bedding as opposed to extra beds where single beds are rolled in.
Breakfast was relatively good for us maybe cos we do not have high expectations. Typical Malaysia n food such as nasi lemak, lontong etc. There are cereals, toast, fruits palette for those who prefer it light.

Our family dined at the small restaurant before we left but unfortunately there was an event going on which resulted in late serving of our food. The other disappointing bit was the fact that some meals (kway teow) were not cooked properly prolly in a rush. Still, we departed happy...the waiter & waitresses were apologetic about the non-availability of some food in their menu and their lacking of service, if any.

Overall, almost excellent service standards and etiquette provided to guests. Recommended hotel!",February 2014,Hotel Bendahara,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g306997-d5990483-Reviews-Hotel_Bendahara-Melaka_Central_Melaka_District_Melaka_State.html,"Melaka, Malaysia",hotels,4.0,3.5
Awesome Experience for Family!,"Where do I start really?
We decided to head there after much homework done.

- Flight from SIN
- Bus to Taoyuan Railway
- Rail from Taoyuan to Tongxiao
- Lastly, cab from Tongxiao to Flying Cow Ranch(FCR)

Was it worth all the hassle? We sure didn't regret the decision.
From the moment we arrived to our departure, everyone there were warm & hospitable. From front desks to cleaners, restaurant and retail even those working on the farms. Not sure if it was rare to them that we were Malay/Muslim who can communicate simply in their language.

Anyhow, we stayed for 2 nites in the quad room. Comfortable beds, clean room, alot of cable channels, WiFi. Altho, the room was basic with kettle, fridge and simple condiments, it gave dat log inn feel. 

The same night we attended a DIY of pancake making session right after check in. Further to our stay, we had a blast with feeding the animals like rabbits, calfs, milking cow, seeing ducks performance, DIY activities like painting cow, making ice cream. It was all fun, fun , fun. I suppose the activities would entertained younger kids than older ones but as parents, we were ecstatic to see how elated our children were. All these kept them occupied & looking forward to the next available activity. 

The ranch will give coupons in exchange for free milk too & boy ...we're in love with the milk, choc one. In fact, we kept buying their other produce - ICE CREAM besides being there in Dec winter!

I was told there  were milk hotspot dinner & western foodies in a couple of different restaurants which we certainly did not opt for being Muslims. Altho, we brought food & ate in the room all the time, our experience there are never short of entertainment & laughter as a family. We truly enjoyed the place. Stay for 3D2N & you won't have to pay extra for DIY or farm entry. Otherwise, we heard it's payable as a separate fee even with a 2D1N stay.

Would we return to the Flying Cow Ranch? We think we just might. Missing the place already now!!! Huhuhu...

Half a day is all u need...,"Having read other reviews, one cannot compare this theme park with the likes of Disneyland or Universal Studios for sure. After all, it's 150k only and certainly cannot expect the world from this place. Oh, for travellers who took Merpati or Air Asia flights into Bandung, be sure to bring your boarding passes along for a 20% discount off entry tics.

While it's great that it is an indoors kind of a park and away from heat of the sun, we covered the place in no time especially when the roller coaster was always under maintenance every now and then. My 8 years old girl enjoyed most of the thrill rides cos she has got simply no fear for such. The one she raved about most was The Giant Swing, which she took a couple of times.
This ride was hell for people with fears for heights.
There was a performance on the atrium stage which appeared impressive with the stunts and choreography of their dances although traditional. Costumes were awesome too.

Rock Climbing was a real challenge but great intro for amateurs. Other than these few, there is a haunted house called Dunia Lain. For those who watch Indo movies and do not fancy the scary ones, this place captures the same essence. Skip it.

One crucial info for all visitors, the park does all of their transactions via a cashcard which can be topped up any moment over most counters. Although, it was a pain to topping up every now and then when we needed, it was still ok for us since there were many counters eased this issue.

Real Authentic Sundanese Food in a really clean place,"Affordable price, clean & the real deal!

Being Singaporean, my family are accustomed to dine in a clean environment everywhere we go. Of course, we may miss cheaper alternatives but just so we can avoid getting food poisoning happening to any of us, we'd do all we can to avoid it.

Back to Sambara, for the 10 of us was 700k only. Meals included beef ribs, large fish, loads of chicken in different marinated flavors or dishes, shrimps, satay, assorted vegetables n a whole lot more. The vege or what some people call ulam are definitely assorted. It's eaten raw with the local spicy sauce.

Please save your time and SKIP tis completely...Clearly a big disappointment,"Sheer waste of money and time. Wax figure not only look different than the real people, the lighting was bad and the place you can cover within 10 mins.

Certainly not worth for the fees incurred. Maybe should avoid if it's not Mdm Tussaud's.

Awesome sight to take in,"We have heard of the auction which is available for booking online. To view that in progress, the visit must be done as early as 5 am.

Otherwise, the only other things you will witness would be the cut up pieces of tuna fish, huge heads of them and of cos their leftovers. Of course, there were other sights to soak in like large oysters, humongous crabs and octopuses.

We had kids with us so we d decided to miss the lil action since it was stipulated already on the website that children should not be brought along.

There are people pushing trolleys and forklift getting around so that should explain why they would encourage children to stay clear of the market.

Some nice vendors will explain the weird looking creature they are selling - to be eaten with some sauce. So yes, there are nice shopkeepers there.

Soak in the atmosphere and the sight for a change from the usual attraction. Oh..don't expect to have your shoes in a great condition cos after all, it is a wet market.

Always a fan of Disneyland,"A lot of reviews much have mentioned that the wait is ridiculous for each ride here.

Well, we went on a Monday and a non-school holiday so although it was crowded, it wasn't that long a wait say 50-60 mins, as shared, per ride. Not sure if we were lucky. We did go against the usual flow of starting the park with Adventureland instead of Tomorrowland.

But the wait was mostly between 10-30 mins per ride at most. Tho I must admit the longest one was worth the wait indeed 70 mins - a photo with Mickey Mouse at his home in Toontown and Monster Inc. Otherwise, we have actually managed rides which took us less than 7 mins wait.

We certainly enjoyed ourselves there and stayed til 10 pm it's closing time. But yeah we intentionally missed some rides especially in Toontown cos it's a little too kiddy for our children. The achievement was to cover at least 80-90 % of Tokyo Disneyland reputed for it's crowd.

And overall, it's a great experience still.

Tips : If you miss the first round, you can meet Mickey and Minnie at the entrance at 11.55 am near the park's entrance. Also, do not delay getting out of Disneyland after closing time as the last train leaves Maihama not long after.

Enjoy Disney!!!",June 2013,Tokyo Disneyland,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g14134868-d320634-Reviews-Tokyo_Disneyland-Maihama_Urayasu_Chiba_Prefecture_Kanto.html,"Maihama, Japan",attractions,5.0,4.5
A little zoo in midst of the city,"We were there in June 13 & found the idea of a huge park equipped w. Thith a zand and tucked in the midst of Tokyo city alluring.

Now we are talking abt shopping and residential areas surrounding it so that we found a lil queer.
Nevertheless, we visited on a rainy day and the zoo was not as crowded as it seemed on other days based on reviews. But we were quite lucky to witness up close and personal, the feeding of the Giant Panda and the humongous Sea Lions. Thus far, entertaining.

The zoo was filled with substantial animals, again, for a city zoo. It was broken up into east and west garden so be ready to spend minimally half a day at least. In order to get to the other side, visitors can take a cute and colorful monorail but this costed around 200yen per pax which we thought should have been made free.

The highlight for us was the enclosure for the beautiful giraffes with pretty and healthy fur. The enclosures were roomy enough for the few of them to gallop a bit and this sight we have yet to see in other zoos we visited. Especially when it is so near and the only thg which separates us from them for like 20-30m were some glass panels.

Educational & Enjoyment ALL-in-ONE!!! A MUST Visit ;),"Beautiful sight and surreal experience for kids and adult alike in a place with butterflies galore!!!

Very much small, enclosed conservatory with butterflies, BEAUTIFUL breeds among others, flying everywhere. Upon entering the farm, you will be greeted by the welcoming setting sub-divided by several sections. Made available up close are not just adult butterflies but also their eggs, larvae left mostly dangling on stems and also caterpillars of different colors crawling in process. In one section, there are incubator-like containers for breeding purposes. If you are lucky, you could have caught some hatching away.

We caught LIVE, some huge Batik-like Moths hanging onto a coconut and butterflies mating in progress. One experience that touches my heart was to have a full fledged adult butterfly crawling on my fingers and hands and viewing them feeding from some fruits that was placed in an open area by the workers of the farm, who by the way, were very informative and friendly at all times. They dispense information on a certain activity or process noting our curiosity whilst at it.

The flowers in the garden were gorgeous especially the orchids of different types made it so very pleasing to the eyes. One of the sad thing about the life of a butterfly besides the short lifespan, they are also easily scattered on the floor when nearing their deaths. A few times, the kids almost trampled on some when they were happily running to the following sections to see more. Suggest to place them on the grass patch area lest they get stepped on easily.

At the end of the farm, as with usual attraction place, was a souvenir shop which carried very cute souvenirs for consideration. The whole family certainly enjoyed ourselves at the end of the day and if you ever wondered whether we would return? Our answer will be most definitely if we returned to Penang. We'd love to see the developments made, if any, and more breeds thats for sure!",June 2012,Entopia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g4975755-d457111-Reviews-Entopia-Teluk_Bahang_Penang_Island_Penang.html,"Penang Island, Malaysia",attractions,5.0,4.5
Adults would enjoy more...,"The rides are mostly catered to adults more so than the kids although there are attractions like viewing panda, fun fair-like section and aquarium. It is a huge park..too huge in fact for my liking cos apparently it was hard to cover all areas especially on a hot day. The shows such as seal and dolphins were done only in native language and so left foreigners who do not understand the language a little bewildered.

What I loved best was the BBQ Squid and the cable car ride although I didn't feel 100% safe with small kids knowing that they could possibly slide through the gaping grills of the car. Bathrooms seems scarce and the environment does not seem to be wheelchair or handicapped friendly.

Overall, just an okay experience unless the standard to match was Disneyland which we visited the day before..hahahaha

Worth a visit anytime,"We went by Central MTR and decided to take the bus as indicated and shared on some website. Unfortunately, we had to wait a long time and the bus never arrived so we decided to walk and find our way there since it was a mere 10-15 mins walking distance.

Having asked the locals, educated or not alike, even those in business attire, did not seem fruitful. So we got to foot of the Peak with directions given by a kind Indian man who is a Hongkong resident ;)

Take the tram ride up to absorb the scenery plus the perks were that each cabin were very much decorated like 50s era...seats are benches made of wood and we felt it was a great experience going up with our 6 & 5 year olds. The tickets can be sold in a package with entrance fee to the Wax Museum inclusive. Do get it...great experience really.

Once in, we were greeted by BrAngelina. All the wax figures looked so real and close to the real people. I was secretly happy that despite the kids not knowing most...ALMOST in fact, the celebrities there, they thouroughly enjoyed the time there posing and making funny faces along with the figures next to them. We spent a good 2-3 hours there.

oh yes, in come section, you can accessorize with your picks and of course, be able to take a photo with the figures as if you were one...hahaha. One of such opportunity was Queen Elizabeth and her royal family.

There's shopping centres all around like Lot 10, Pavilion, Fahrenheit, Sungei Wang...7-11 right downstairs at Level 1 next to its cafe, cheap or expensive food and within minutes to Bukit Bintang LRT.

What more can anyone ever ask for? Safe and really clean too for us who had grandparents and young children in our group. Definitely recommended.

Walking distance probably around 5-7 mins to nearest Tsim Tsa Tsui MTR station, convenience stores all over the place. Muslim food right downstairs for halal mediterranean cuisines. Generally, safe environment. Comfortable stay for our travelling party of 2 Adults and 2 Kids.

The superb plus was although it does not come with a washer like an apartment, the room come with fridge (standard) and microwave! Now, a standard hotel does not include such and it helps for us to heat up our leftover kebabs after removal from the frideg. Voila.....need I say more?

Gem in the middle of Siem Reap,"This review may come in a tad late considering that our stay in GB Resort was in June 12. Still, we thought that it should do justice for the services and wonderful stay we had at the boutique resort.

Our family of 2A and 2C was most pleased with the smiley staffs and the ambience of the hotel. The breakfast thought not much of a variety was adequate for the short stay and catered to the kids as well.
Though the hotel seemingly has a bigger ration of men than women or kids, this is a safe and clean hotel to be staying in. We had the ground floor deluxe villa room which overlooked the pool and had the tub and shower in the open area of the upper floor. Almost a perfect experience expecially with staffs like Seth who attended to us at the reception. The others were generally friendly as well.

The only few problem we had were caused by the tuk tuk driver, Yem Chinda (see photo pass provided) and the driver assigned to transfer us to the Airport. Chinda was either sarcastic and rude as we had chosen to ride the tuk tuk for our Ang Kor Wat tour, as opposed to his suggestion for a car instead, seemingly for our comfort (more like for his due to waiting time in the hot weather). He was clearly not happy that we did not follow his suggestion for the sequence of the site we wanted to visit. As for the driver who took us to the Airport, he arrived much later than scheduled and almost caused us to miss the flight back. That was crazy!
