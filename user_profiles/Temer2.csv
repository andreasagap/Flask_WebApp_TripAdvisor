Fab farm stall,"Every time we visit Cape Town, we make our first stop the Peregrine Farm Stall for their fabulous pastries and biltong.
Over the years, this superb stall has grown both in size and popularity and the last time we visited, the queues were quite long (a coach had arrived) but the service is always excellent and the food is worth waiting for!
We also took my in-laws on our last visit (I managed to get 3 trips to the Peregrine in 2 weeks!) and my MIL loved it - we had a look at all the delicious offerings in the shop and bakery, plus at the more recently added stands that sell other wares such as leather goods.
There is loads of parking, plenty of seating and space to stretch your legs if you've just got off a long flight. I would never land in CT and not visit the Peregrine. The staff are so friendly, particularly at the bakery/ hot food area. I would highly recommend their fabulous apple turnovers (probably the best I've tasted and I can never resist them) and my husband particularly likes their biltong, but everything we have bought from there has been excellent and fresh.
If you're in the area, a trip to the Peregrine Farm Stall is a must.",March 2020,Peregrine Farm Stall,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1931831-d8441722-Reviews-Peregrine_Farm_Stall-Grabouw_Overberg_District_Western_Cape.html,"Grabouw, South Africa",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Ground with a view,"We visited Newlands for an England v South Africa match and had a fantastic afternoon... and the view was just incredible!
Watching England at Newlands has been on my 'bucket list' for years so last year, we booked tickets and had a mini break in Claremont (20mins walk from the ground). We decided to upgrade to a shared box and despite the facilities being basic, thought the extra was money well spent for the meal, view and extra protection from the searing heat (it was 33°).
We arrived as early as we could and were only the 3rd group in the box which holds around 20, decided where to sit (I seem to recall we could sit anywhere so chose the frow) and went inside to get a drink. All drinks (alcoholic and non) were included as was a 3 course meal of buffet style hams, samosa style snacks (which were amazing), cheese, fruits etc, a choice of 2 or 3 full on hot meals and lovely chocolate cake. Although seating inside the box was limited, there was plenty outside.
As mentioned, the facilities are quite basic and the toilets are on alternate levels, so we had to go up a level to use the toilets, but everything was clean (the toilets were cleaned after each use) and tidy and the staff were excellent.
The game we watched was very close, and the atmosphere in the ground and amongst our fellow fans - both Brits and South Africans - was superb. It ran over time and watching the sun set over the extraordinarily beautiful view was amazing. Definitely worth a visit, and if you can afford to, upgrade to a box for something a little special without losing the atmosphere.",March 2020,PPC Newlands Cricket,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g312582-d6750786-Reviews-PPC_Newlands_Cricket-Newlands_Western_Cape.html,"Newlands, South Africa",attractions,4.0,4.5
Cool cafe,"A group of 4 of us visited Wester Cafe as the meeting point for our trip with Those Dam Boat Guys and we had a fun couple of hours in the small cool cafe.
We arrived early as it was a short walk over the canal from the Anne Frank House so we thought we'd grab a drink before our trip - we managed to have quite a few between us, along with some cake before setting off.
The lady behind the bar was great and friendly and the service was pretty good. We were lucky to get a table right in the window as it was quite busy - mainly with people waiting for the boat trips and just sat and enjoyed the chilled out atmosphere.
We visited pre Covid and seating was very cosy, but at the time it added to the atmosphere.
Great little place",February 2020,Wester Cafe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g188590-d2659949-Reviews-Wester_Cafe-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Dam great trip,"We visited Amsterdam with friends (another couple) who had seen Those Dam Boat Guys on Richard Ayoade's Travel Man programme and thought it looked pretty cool.... and they weren't wrong. We booked our tickets about 3 weeks ahead as we wanted an early evening cruise to watch the sun set over the canals and turned up at the recommended bar over an hour ahead of our booked time, so enjoyed 3 beers each - very nice indeed. When it came to getting on the boat - this was pre covid times - there were about 12 of us. The seating arrangements are quite 'cosy' but very comfortable and as they're small boats, everyone gets an opportunity to see all the stunning sights Amsterdam's canals have to offer - there's not a bad seat in the house!
Those Dam Boat Guys let you take your own food and drink onboard so we got some snacks, a couple of bottles of prosecco and some beer for the journey which we cracked open as soon as we set off.
Our guide was Michael who was absolutely brilliant - he was informative, funny and happy to answer any questions. Anything goes and there's no topic off limits - though we had 2 young children 10 & 13 on board so may have been toned down.
We started before sunset and watched the lights come out on the stunning canals - we were very lucky with the weather as it was very cold (but they give everyone a blanket to wrap up in) but dry. There are plastic sides that can be taken down when it rains though. Michael literally talked for the whole tour, pointing out all the usual tourist attractions and some other, more quirky sights. They advertise the tour as 90 minutes but ours lasted for almost 2 hours and there was nothing rushed about it. Those Dam Boat Guys run tours for the more relaxed tourist - if you want an organised tout with an itinerary, this isn't for you. But if you want a fantastic trip that shows you the main sights and goes where the captain fancies that evening, this is perfect - it's a more liberal, laid back tour but all the better for it.
Fortunately we were on a trip where noone smoked but I believe they also allow that - in fact we were the only ones drinking and were quite merry at the end of the almost 2 hour tour so possibly the annoying tourists.
Whilst I'm sure they guides get paid well, please tip them as their inside knowledge and fun facts make this a brilliant value tour.
Our tour with Those Dam Boat Guys was the highlight of our trip to Amsterdam - Michael was brilliant and it was a brilliant way to see this beautiful city.",February 2020,Those Dam Boat Guys,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g188590-d8064405-Reviews-Those_Dam_Boat_Guys-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",attractions,5.0,5.0
Wonderful canals,"Amsterdam's canals are legendary but when I saw them for the first time on our mini break I just loved them immediately. There are so many different areas you can walk around all connected by canals and it feels safe during the day and romantic walking cobbled streets at night. We walked for about 5 hours in 1 day whilst at Amsterdam and could have done more if time had permitted - most of it along the maze of canals - so take comfy shoes and start exploring. Even better, take a boat trip and enjoy Amsterdam at night- simply stunning.",February 2020,Amsterdam Canal Ring,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g188590-d8609333-Reviews-Amsterdam_Canal_Ring-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",attractions,5.0,4.5

Fit for Royalty!,"We visited Restaurant Kastel.while on a day trip to Zadar and what an absolute gem of an eatery it is. A group.if 5 of us just wanted a light lunch when we came across this impressive looking hotel so decided to eat in the restaurant. The food was simply fabulous, the service impeccable and the views from the top were lovely.
The staff were so friendly and helped my mum up in the lift while the rest of us walked up the stairs and really went out of their way to look after us. The menu all looked delicious and we had a selection of dishes, all of which were cooked perfectly. While we were eating, we watched the waiters impressive knife skills on a plate of fish. This is definitely a fabulous establishment in this beautiful city a short walk from the harbour.

Fabulous inside and out,"The views are enough to make Ristorante Principessa a number one choice for tourists visiting Venice, but the establishment has so much more to offer.
We popped in for a coffee before we got our shuttle boat back to our cruise ship but the coffee was so good, we ordered another and an alcoholic drink and just couldn't resist the amazing looking ice creams so got a dessert each too.
The service is exceptional and all the staff are friendly despite being a real tourist restaurant.

Theres so much to see and do - wander along the streets, look at the restaurants and shops, or just sit at a bar overlooking the stunning, inviting turquoise sea.

Beautiful Bay,"We visited the Bay of Kotor as a day trip in a cruise and I think it's of the most beautiful harbours I have ever visited. Travelling in, the scenery was stunning and reminiscent of the Norwegian fjords, and for me the trip to Montenegro was the highlight of a 2 week holiday.

The stunning architecture with plenty of other ruins to see, plus beautiful views out across the land and to sea make for a great day out.
We had to queue in the heat and then it's quite a climb up fairly slippery marble amongst massive crowds so maybe better to see on a sightseeing bus (as my parents and sister did) if you're less moble.
There were lots of people (and we arrived around 10am) and it was quite disorganised getting up to the Acropolis but far more orderly getting down.

Ok but disorganised,"Anne Frank's story is harrowing and a massive part of Amsterdam's history but I was a bit disappointed with the museum. I haven't read Anne Frank's diaries so the visit to the museum was a whistlestop tour but it all felt a bit hectic and disorganised. We went while on a mini cruise so booked our tickets as soon as they were available (a month or so ahead of sailing), and had to queue outside. It starts off quite well where only the people in the allotted time slot are allowed in the house but once you're in, it seems a bit of a free for all and we didn't even get to see her diaries at the end of the tour as we just couldn't get near them. We took about an hour going around but I wouldnt have spent more time there and also be aware of booing if you have any sort of mobility issue as there are large and very steep steps to negotiate and I didn't feel safety was a priority - I understand they want to keep it as authentic as it was but it just felt a bit like a hazard around every corner.",February 2020,Anne Frank House,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g188590-d190555-Reviews-Anne_Frank_House-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",attractions,3.0,4.5

Ladies in windows,"A group of 4 of us (2 couples) wandered through the Red Light District at around 9pm on a Saturday night and I have slightly mixed feelings about the area. It's nowhere near as sleazy as some make it out to be and is actually quite an organised and I think good way of ensuring the safety of these ladies. Some are beautiful and all are barely dressed, and it's obviously their job, but most smile as you walk past, though some did look a bit bored as they were looking at their phones. The ladies are literally standing (or sitting) in a person shaped window selling their wares with something to cater for all tastes. I didn't feel uncomfortable at all visiting with my husband- only for a walk through the area - and my only concern is whether the ladies are all selling themselves because they want to, but that would be the same for anywhere in the world. At least in Amsterdam, it's a legitimate industry and these ladies are more protected than in other areas. The whole area felt fairly safe to walk through though I wouldn't want to do it on my own and you could smell weed far more strongly in this area than the other places we visited.",February 2020,Red Light District,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g188590-d190584-Reviews-Red_Light_District-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",attractions,4.0,4.0
Fab break,"We visited Devonvale Golf & Wine Estate for a couple of nights last February and really enjoyed the relaxing atmosphere, friendly staff and peaceful surroundings.
I booked a few weeks ahead and asked for a ground floor room for my in-laws, which they were given with direct access out its private garden across to the restaurant. My husband and I were given the room above them which was perfect. The rooms are actually 1 bed apartments which are decorated beautifully and are fully appointed with dining table, cutlery and crockery. We were each in the very first room from reception and our room had a good size balcony with nice side views but my in-law's room was fab with it's own private garden, BBQ and seating. My MIL loved the apartment and actually preferred it to a more expensive resort in Stellenbosch we had stayed in a few years ago because she could watch TV and relax in the lounge while her husband had an afternoon nap.
The first afternoon, I went for a walk around the resort- it's quite small so didnt take long and enjoyed a couple of hours relaxing by the pool which is set in nice gardens surrounded by other apartments.
We ate in the only restaurant for breakfast, lunch and dinner and there was a very good selection of dishes available served by the friendliest staff. They really went out of their way for us. We were celebrating a special birthday and one of the ladies serving us brought a complimentary glass of fizz for my mother in law, and all of the staff in the restaurant were very attentive.
The food was all cooked beautifully and 2 of the male waiting staff looked after us for the whole time we were there - they were so friendly and had a laugh with us and told us jokes. It wasn't packed in the restaurant but they made us feel like we were the only guests in there they were so attentive. And when I went for breakfast on my own, they made sure I had the best seat on the balcony.
We sat inside as my father in law gets coks in the evenings but the sunsets were so stunning I kept going out to take photos. If you can, take an outside seat and enjoy mother nature at her best.
My husband and I went out on the golf course one afternoon and I was delighted by the deer and ducks that walked around the course. The scenery was lovely and it felt so relaxing just being out in the sunshine. I would recommend taking out a cart though as it was very hot in February and fair sized course.
In all, we had a fab break at Devonvale Golf & Wine Resort, which was great value which is why I have given a full 5 stars. It's not as glam as other similar resorts, but the staff are excellent, it's nice to have an apartment instead of a room and it was superb value for money.",February 2020,Devonvale Golf & Wine Estate,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g312673-d1741674-Reviews-Devonvale_Golf_Wine_Estate-Stellenbosch_Western_Cape.html,"Stellenbosch, South Africa",hotels,5.0,4.5

Fabulous at Thirty,"I booked Thirty on Grace for one night when we were visiting CT last month and everything was perfect from start to finish.
I contacted the hotel as soon as I booked to see whether it would be possible to arrive early as we were in CT for a cricket match at Newlands and Ros, the owner, was very accommodating and said this was fine. We arrived at around 12 and asked straight away about whether it was possible to arrange a cab or walk to Newlands and Ros, very generously offered to drive us as she was going somewhere nearby. We quickly dropped our stuff off at our room (number 5) and went down to meet Ros, who gave us a lift to within 5mins walk of Newlands.
When the match finished, we couldn't get a cab back so decided to walk, although I wouldn't recommend this so late at night (around 8.30 - 9.00pm) as you do have to go through some areas that didn't look so welcoming (past open land/ subways etc), we were fine and I'm sure it would feel safer during the day - it was only a 20minute walk so would be a pleasant stroll during the day.
When we got back to Thirty on Grace, which is situated on a lovely street of large houses, we let ourselves in and took a couple of bottles of water from the honesty bar. We both showered in the nice en-suite and fell straight to sleep. Although there isn't any air-con in the room, large fans are provided and this was sufficient for us though the room was warm when we arrived on a 33° day. We slept very well.in the large, comfy bed and when I woke the following morning, I stepped out onto our patio to a beautiful sight of mountains covered in early morning clouds (around 6am).
I made a cup of coffee and took some of the rusks that were in the room (and the best rusks I have ever tasted) out to enjoy in the sun.
I went down to have breakfast around 9am and the table had been set up outside for us, which was fabulous. I had fruit salad, bacon, mushrooms and toast which was brought to me by a lovely member of staff and when my husband came to join me, although he had said he didn't want any breakfast,the same was brought for him, which he thoroughly enjoyed and kept us going for the day.
I think the room we stayed in was one of the smallest as it was the last one available but it was still a beautiful room and the hospitality was second to none. Every time we come to Cape Town I try to stay in a different area, and Claremont is a lovely little town and Thirty on Grace is the perfect accommodation. We visited Kirstenbosch the following day and it was a 10minute drive.
We loved it here and I was only disappointed not to be staying for another night.",February 2020,Thirty on Grace,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g2144715-d10408355-Reviews-Thirty_on_Grace-Claremont_Western_Cape.html,"Claremont, South Africa",hotels,5.0,5.0
Fantastic,"Last year we discovered Eat, Sleep Shop in Bredasdorp Square and it was the best new find in the region so decided to visit this year again and found the food just as delicious and the welcome and hospitality absolutely fantastic.
We visited for breakfast on a Saturday and got a lovely table in the sun with a large parasol. The hostess, Zanele, was super and worried about our sitting in the hot sun, but it was just what we wanted at the start of our holiday. I had a steak sandwich and my husband had a full breakfast - both were absolutely delicious. The staff are all superb and check you're happy with your food but Zanele was fantastic - the perfect hostess. She even remembered us when we returned a few days later, despite it always being busy. During the week, it was quieter but on the Saturday we got the last outside front facing table and people kept coming.
The shop has a lovely array of gift items and the view out the front is lovely of Bredasdorp Square. You almost don't realise you're right on the main road.
There is a large menu with a mouthwatering selection but on each occasion I had a sandwich (one was a panini) and they were both absolutely fantastic.
Bredasdorp is one of the larger towns in the area with lots of shops so probably not somewhere you'd stop on a holiday, but Eat, Sleep, Shop in Bredasdorp Sqaure should definitely be on the itinerary. I can't recommend it highly enough.",February 2020,Bredasdorp Square Eat Sleep Shop,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g668268-d3148947-Reviews-Bredasdorp_Square_Eat_Sleep_Shop-Bredasdorp_Overberg_District_Western_Cape.html,"Bredasdorp, South Africa",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Super Suntouched,"My husband and I visit the Suntouched Inn every time we are in Napier - I insist on it! It's such a fab bar with a cool vibe and even if we just have a couple of drinks while were waiting for their pizzas, it's a place I just love for some reason.
Although it's definitely not fancy, the bar has such a warm atmosphere - there are never too many people there so you can always get a seat, but there are enough people to make it fun. The pool table is always in use and people are constantly arriving for their pizza, which is delicious.
This year, we only visited twice - once to get a pizza and once for a pre dinner night out, though you can eat in. We've only ever had pizza and drinks at the Suntouched Inn, but they've always been great and the service is laid back but very good. I was chatting to the owner/ manager while my hubby and brother in law played and she introduced me to some family friends from England. I didn't feel uncomfortable sitting alone at all and the whole place is welcoming. If you went in on your own, but wanted a chat, you would get it.
They do also have a restaurant and accommodation but we have never used either. The Suntouched Inn is a quirky bar, but definitely worth visiting.",February 2020,The Suntouched Inn Travellers Lodge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1138975-d1600475-Reviews-The_Suntouched_Inn_Travellers_Lodge-Napier_Overberg_District_Western_Cape.html,"Napier, South Africa",hotels,4.0,4.0
Excellent again,"We discovered JD Bistro a couple of years ago when we were staying in Napier and it has become our top breakfast/ brunch spot in the area.
My husband and I visited 3 times on our most recent trip, introducing my brother-in-law on the second occasion - he must also have been impressed as he came for the 3rd visit too.
This year, it seemed busier than usual, though we did still manage to get sat outside twice (the best table is the large one at the front facing the road) so picking a good time to eat is crucial. We were there around 10.30am which was probably a bit too late to get the outside tables. On each visit, the food was delicious and the coffee is excellent. I have to have a decent coffee in the morning and JD's was excellent- I don't usually have one after 11, especially in the hot sun, but I couldn't resist.
The service I'd also superb - there's a young chap who has been with then for a while now who is an excellent waiter.
We did have a pizza each for brunch one day and they were great but the breakfasts are always fab too though the portions seem to have reduced in size.
It's a dog friendly restaurant and there are always well behaved canines around.
If you're staying in Napier, or just driving through, JD Bistro is definitely worth stopping at.",February 2020,JD Bistro,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1138975-d8280700-Reviews-JD_Bistro-Napier_Overberg_District_Western_Cape.html,"Napier, South Africa",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Perfect Pascal's,"We visit Pascal's every year when we're in Napier and always receive a warm welcome, great good and fabulous hospitality.
We only visited the restaurant once on our recent trip but were welcomed like old friends from all the team (animals included) - it's definitely mind of restaurant you immediately feel at home in. With an interesting array of art and nicknacks to look at inside and a lovely outside area, Pascal's also has a great menu with a wide selection to choose from. Whilst we were waiting for our food, load shedding (planned times electricity outages lasting for a couple of hours) occurred, but the owners took this as an opportunity to speak with the guests while their generator kicked in. Owners Mark and Stephen are superb hosts and really go out of their way to make a visit to Pascal's a delightful dining experience. When our food arrived, it all tasted great and 3 of us managed to get a dessert in. Their cheesecake is legendary and well worth trying.
I also have to mention their cocktails as I had an amazing frozen gin cocktail. I can't remember what it was called but it was so delicious I had a second one (though I must admit I felt slightly and delightfully tipsy once I'd had them both).
Although we didn't stay in Pascal's accommodation, we have on 4 previous occasions and they are also lovely. We always take the same self-contained unit, but I think they now have 3 and the views are stunning and the walk to the restaurant through the gardens is a joy. All in all, Pascal's is your perfect pit stop for a few nights in this cute town, which is only a short drive (30mins) to some beautiful beaches, Agulhas where the oceans meet, and some lovely walks.",February 2020,Pascal's of Napier,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1138975-d1937415-Reviews-Pascal_s_of_Napier-Napier_Overberg_District_Western_Cape.html,"Napier, South Africa",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Airport Oasis,"We decided to book No1 Lounge at Gatwick's South Terminal as my parents hadn't flown for 5 years and thought it may be a less stressful experience for them - how right we were.
We booked ahead of time and despite our check in being delayed, we were taken to our seats and given our menus. We went straight to the bar and ordered some prosecco for the ladies and lager for the chaps, for a few snacks and placed our food order. We got some soft drinks and more bubbles and beer - the service was quick and friendly. We got a discount as we booked through our cruise company but the price was well worth it.
My sister, husband and I decided to do a bit of last minute shopping and stepping out of this airport oasis into the main hub made us realise just how noisy and nightmarish airports can be. We quickly got our duty free and returned. We will definitely consider No1 Lounge for a pre holiday treat - especially when we next fly long-haul.",August 2019,No1 Lounge - Gatwick South,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g191265-d11931992-Reviews-No1_Lounge_Gatwick_South-Horley_Surrey_England.html,"Horley, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,2.5
Wonderful White Bear,"My parents took my husband and I to The White Bear in Ruislip for a Saturday lunch and we had a delicious meal in lovely surroundings receiving amongst the best service I've had in a long time.
We were greeted warmly and brought our drinks and after perusing the menu, made our choices- 2 of us had stroganoff (1 with rice, 1 with chips) and 2 had fish. The food arrived piping hot and was absolutely delicious and throughout the whole meal, the staff kept asking if we were happy, if we'd like more drinks and if they could get us anything else. The service really was exceptional- attentive and friendly without being too much.
We all had a dessert and a coffee and left having had brilliant lunch.
I hadn't been to The White Horse for many years (since it was a pub), but my parents who live locally had previously enjoyed a few meals there. It's been updated really nicely (I think it's part of the Price and Brunning chain who update pubs very sympathetically) and still has a fair sized car park out the back which is handy as there's no street parking nearby.

What a Show!,"I absolutely love the film, so when the opportunity came to see Evita at Regent's Park open air theatre came up, it was one not to miss.
A group of 6 girlfriends managed to get fantastic seats (£65 a ticket, so not cheap, but well worth it) and arrived at the large park looking for the theatre. It's not brilliantly sign posted but we found it within about 10mins and went inside where we ordered a bottle of bubbles (plus one for the interval) and made our way to our seats.
This was one of the last performances and as the evenings are definitely more autumnal now, wrapping up warm was a good decision.
Ths show itself was superb - a traditional story told in a modern way with a minimal stage and the actors in trendy clothes and trainers - a great juxtaposition for some of the glamorous songs.
The actors were fabulous - amazing voices and dance routines - and the setting was really atmospheric with the trees rustling throughout the evening.

Grove's gem at The Glasshouse,"We visited The Glasshouse at The Grove recently for my dad's 75th birthday and had an absolutely fantastic time with superb food, served by lovely staff in stunning surroundings.
My husband and I arrived quite early and were warmly welcomed by Karen who said we could sit at the bar while we waited for the rest of our party to arrive. It was a beautiful day so we decided to sit outside and ordered their lemonade (refreshing and delicious).
Once all of our party had arrived, hostess Karen remembered which group we were and showed us to our table which was a fabulous booth with chairs in a large section which we had to ourselves for the entire meal.
Our waitress for the day was the excellent Aga, who explained the buffet concept and brought our drinks over.
There is a huge selection of food on offer - for starters, most of our party went for the seafood (the prawns were huge and looked delicious) and I chose cheese and biscuits. Upon Aga's recommendation, most of us selected the oriental soup, which is made to order and you can select to have spicy or mild depending on your tastebuds. You can also select which spices you like and meat if you wish. I went for chicken and it was perfect- the portion isn't too large but you could have larger if desired. My husband and dad went for the pasta which also looked delicious.
The selection for mains included steak, lamb, chicken and a pie but the absolute best was the tomahawk steak which was carved to order and served medium rare (close to rare in the middle) and was perfect. A delicious selection of vegetables, including fluffy roast potatoes accompanied.
The mouthwatering selection of desserts meant I ate more than I should - lemon and raspberry sorbet with fruit, mini meringues and a raspberry lollipop which was delicious. There were also mini chocolate, vanilla and creme brulee.
Once we'd finished our meal, Aga and another waitress brought us coffees (I had fresh mint tea which was amazing) and the cake Mum had ordered for Dad and we all sang. Unfortunately, we were too full to eat it, but my parents have since said how delicious it was.
We went in for our meal at 1.30 and didn't leave The Glasshouse until around 5pm which meant we had a lovely leisurely lunch. The whole time our waitress, Aga, was brilliant - friendly, chatty and helpful with drinks and dishes options and Karen rememberes us on the way out.
We decided to sit back outside and enjoy the late afternoon sun whilst having another drink and after having a little walk around the stunning grounds, eventually left around 6.30.
We had all been to The Glasshouse previously and knew how lovely it is, but Tuesday was a great reminder and we all had the most fabulous afternoon.

"Beautiful views, bad service","My husband and I met my parents and sister at The Old Orchard for a Saturday lunch in June and I was delighted to discover it's still got the beautiful surroundings and views I remember but was a bit disappointed with the food and the service was not good at all.
Part of the Brunning & Price chain, I had high expectations as we have 2 of their restaurants near us in Surrey which are fantastic so was looking forward to our meal.
My parents and sister were already seated at a lovely round table in the window with stunning views over the lake but it took ages for our drinks order to be taken. When they arrived, we placed our food order - a steak & chips, fish & chips and 3 duck noodles. The fish and steak arrived a full 5 minutes before the noodle dishes which arrived cold. We didn't send them back as we weren't sure how long they'd take to come back. I just say the food was good when it arrived though it would have been nice to have it warm.
We ordered desserts - 3 white chocolate cheesecakes which came with cherry sorbet which I asked to swap mine only for raspberry sorbet. When they arrived, all the sorbets looked the same so I asked if they were cherry or raspberry as I had asked for raspberry. The waiter took mine back and returned it - with cherry sorbet on so I had to swap with my husband who had raspberry sorbet he hadn't asked for.
The Old Orchard is a beautiful restaurant with stunning views and it's a shame the service lets it down - it was very busy and it's like the staff know they don't have to work too hard as they always have customers. If the service was better and the staff cared more and the food was delivered together warm, this place could be fantastic. The view are the best thing at the moment.",June 2019,The Old Orchard,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1646049-d1948387-Reviews-The_Old_Orchard-Uxbridge_Greater_London_England.html,"Uxbridge, United Kingdom",restaurants,3.0,4.0
"Good food, great bar","A colleague and I visited The Refinery at Regent's Place for lunch last month and I was very impressed at the food - I had a duck salad and my colleague had a fish finger sandwich which arrived with chips that looked delicious.
My salad was crisp, fresh and there was plenty of duck in it and both portions were a good size - almost too much for me for lunch.
The service was a bit slow though which was a shame and the place is extremely noisy - we sat by the window, not in the centre and still it was difficult to hear.
I also visited recently for drinks with friends and had an excellent service- they had put aside an area for us and we got floor service meaning our drinks were brought over quickly and the staff were superb.

The restaurant is clearly geared up for pre theatre diners and when we arrived at 5.30 wasn't very busy but when we left just after 7pm was completely full. Food is delicious, hot and served quickly and for a pizza, icecream and drink came to just £35 per person so is also great value for money.

Bredasdorp's Best!,"We've been visiting this part of South Africa's Overberg region for a decade and I've always wanted to try the Eat, Sleep, Shop in the Square as it's the prettiest building in the town. So this year, my husband and I went for breakfast one day - and loved it so much, we visited twice more in a week.
The first time we visited was mid morning, so we had a delicious brunch (my hubby had a full breakfast and I had a toasted sandwich with chips) and sat outside in the sun with a parasol. The chap who served us was fabulous and worried we may be too hot so offered us a table on their lovely stoep, but we hadn't seen any sun for months, so it was a treat to sit outside and catch some rays.
The food was delicious and the service was exceptional so a few days later, we took my in-laws for a visit and they were equally delighted and surprised at this fabulous establishment.
Again we visited for brunch and this time sat inside, where the sumptuous surroundings make you feel like you could stay all day.
We chose a table next to one of the fireplaces but there were several to choose from, all with a good amount of space so you don't feel like you're encroaching on someone else's mealtime. They even have an area out the back where you can eat - they have an uncovered small pond - there is a sign, but worth noting if you have young children or dogs.
There is also a delightful little shop, where you can purchase locally made wares - trinkets and fabrics plus amazing looking food items.
Each time we visited, the staff were superb and couldn't do enough for us - they were friendly, attentive and quick to bring our food and drink.
Out of all the restaurants we visited this time, Eat, Sleep, Shop in Bredasdorp Square was my favourite and we will definitely be back when we visit in 2019.",March 2019,Bredasdorp Square Eat Sleep Shop,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g668268-d3148947-Reviews-Bredasdorp_Square_Eat_Sleep_Shop-Bredasdorp_Overberg_District_Western_Cape.html,"Bredasdorp, South Africa",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Brilliant Black Oystercatcher,"A group of 4 of us visited the Black Oystercatcher for lunch and had a delicious meal served by friendly helpful staff.
Upon arrival, we walked from the car park through the lovely gardens where you can see all the fruit and vegetables they grow, up the stairs (there are quite a few which is worth bearing in mind if you have a lack of mobility) and up to the shop which sells a lovely array of Black Oystercatcher wines, then along to the restaurant.
When we arrived it was mid week and quite early so there was only one other group in the large but welcoming restaurant. We chose a table and were brought our drinks quickly. While we waited, we admired the restaurant, which is a barn style with a large fireplace and even had little birds (they may have been swifts) with nests in the beams.
Our food arrived and it was a large but delicious lunch - we had a cheeseburger, fish of the day, Waldorf salad and the steak pan - all of which we loved. The steak pan was particularly good and with 3 beers and 2 soft drinks came to 650R which is around £36 so superb value for money.
The Black Oystercatcher has a lovely outlook which on a sunny day would be stunning, but even when it was overcast was still pretty and has a nice modern feel with a pond out the front where their adorable dog kept taking a dip.
I don't know whether they cater for large parties, but it would be an amazing venue for a wedding or special occasion.

Great bar,"The Suntouched Inn is always on our list of restaurants to visit when we are staying in Napier and despite a flying visit earlier this year, we managed to get a few drinks and pizzas from this locals establishment.
There is a restaurant at the front that you enter from the road but we always go to the bar at the back, order our pizzas - they have a great choice of toppings - and have a few drinks while we're waiting. We usually order 4 pizzas - they're a good size but one per person is recommended as they're not massive - and by the time we've had 2 beers, they're ready.
The Suntouched Inn has a great selection of pizza toppings and you can build your own if you like. I'm sure they do other food, but we've only had their pizza.
The bar has a great open/ outside area that can be closed off and there's plenty of seating.

We both had the Big Boy breakfasts but as I can't eat egg, got extra bacon and all was cooked perfectly. The coffee is delicious and despite the slightly inclement weather when we visited, we still sat outside and enjoyed the peaceful view (of the road but it's fairly quiet and there is a wooded area opposite).

Always great,"We visit Pascals every time we're in Napier and we always enjoy a great meal in quirky surroundings served by great staff.
When we were in the area in March, we visited Pascals for breakfast, which never disappoints and dinner. On both occasions we had delicious food and during the evening, the very friendly owners walked round talking to their customers. This is a really nice touch as it shows their warm hospitality.
The food is always great and Pascals is a fab restaurant with both indoor and outdoor seating.",March 2019,Pascal's of Napier,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1138975-d1937415-Reviews-Pascal_s_of_Napier-Napier_Overberg_District_Western_Cape.html,"Napier, South Africa",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Lunch with a view,"My husband and I have been meaning to visit the Arniston Spa Hotel for lunch for quite a while and whilst we were in Napier in March, we had a drive out to enjoy a meal with a stunning view.
My husband had fish and chips and I enjoyed a delicious falafel wrap served fairly quickly by friendly staff. We were there during a mid week lunch and only 3 other tables outside on the patio were in use so we had a fantastic view of the ocean but I know it gets very busy there as we have mentioned visiting on previous trips but it was too busy.
We both popped inside to use the restrooms and I took an opportunity to have a look at the pool. The hotel itself looks very nice and the pool area looked relaxing.
There isn't much to do in Arniston but it's a pretty little town and there are lots of lovely places to visit locally so the Arniston Spa would make a perfect base.
We really enjoyed our lunch with a view and will definitely visit Arniston Spa for lunch again.",March 2019,Arniston Spa Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1015441-d635323-Reviews-Arniston_Spa_Hotel-Arniston_Overberg_District_Western_Cape.html,"Arniston, South Africa",hotels,4.0,4.5
Great small chain,"I've been in this branch of Black Sheep Coffee a few times as I work nearby and the coffee and service are always very good.
This is quite a large branch with plenty of seating so nice for informal meetings, though it can get a bit noisy. They have a funky interior and serve cocktails later in the day. Very convenient for Great Portland Street and Warren Street stations.",April 2019,Black Sheep Coffee - Regents Place,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d12696423-Reviews-Black_Sheep_Coffee_Regents_Place-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Great Coffee Shop at Goodge St,"My sister and I visited Black Sheep Coffee on Goodge Street last Friday for an iced tea and received an excellent service and delicious cuppa in small but perfectly formed surroundings. They also had nice looking snacks but we were having lunch elsewhere, so didn't get an opportunity to try them.
They also have a branch at Regent's Place which serves cocktails in the evening and is nice for a few post work drinks.",May 2019,Black Sheep Coffee - Goodge St,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d5779420-Reviews-Black_Sheep_Coffee_Goodge_St-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Fantastic Mr Fogg's!,"My sister and I visited Mr. Fogg's House of Botanicals early this evening for some cocktails and were lucky enough to be the first people to be seated in the lovely upstairs area, where we received a fabulous service, mouthwatering drinks and had a thoroughly enjoyable couple of hours.
We arrived at the establishment at 4.30 and started our drinks downstairs where we received a warm welcome and were told we could sit wherever we wanted - there were plenty of seats to choose from at this time on a Friday afternoon. We were brought a glass of orange infused water and the drinks menu where we chose stunning cocktails which were made at the delightful bar and brought to us by another friendly member of the team.
When the upstairs area opened, our hostess took us up and seated us near the bar. The seating is fabulous - comfy chairs, little tables and cool music. As we were the first people up, we received an amazing service and all the staff greeted us warmly, with another glass of water being brought to us immediately. We were then brought test-tubes of botanicals which are infused in the drinks with a little bit of information about each. Quite a simple concept but with a great impact as it lets you get hands on with the scents and is a fun talking point. The superb staff explained the drinks and when I said I would try one was told it's very strong and asked if I was ready for it. Having already had a couple of cocktails and champagne elsewhere, I decided to go for something less potent and chose an amazing rose drink that was served in a jam jar. My sister also chose a great cocktail that was served in a bowl.
I asked if I could put a tiny cake out on the table for my sister's birthday and the wonderful staff agreed and had the top floor singing 'Happy Birthday' to her when she returned from the toilet. They also gave her a mini cocktail as i had put this special occasion in when booking. Such a small thing to do but absolutely brilliant and so sweet of the 'top team'.
We had another cocktail each and decided to order some mozzarella balls and fries which were all delicious and the fries were served with an orange infused mayo which was very tasty.
Unfortunately, you can only book Mr Fogg's for 2 hours and 5 minutes before 7pm, we were advised the table would be required - only a shame as we would have stayed for another couple of drinks, but we had a great time and had already spent almost £70, which included service charge (100% worth it!) and I thought was great value.
Mr Fogg's House of Botanicals was a superb find and the staff really went our of their way to ensure we enjoyed our evening. They couldn't have done more for us. An absolutely fantastic London find and we will definitely be trying more of their branches.",May 2019,Mr. Fogg's House of Botanicals,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d14246198-Reviews-Mr_Fogg_s_House_of_Botanicals-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Brilliant Team building,"We visited Escape Rooms for a work function, taking over 2 rooms and had a brilliant night out.
It took us a little while to get started, working out the clues, but once we got into it, worked really well as smaller teams within a team and got really competitive wanting to beat the team in the other room to 'escape' first.
We all had pizzas and drinks after and took some photos and were out within a couple of hours.
Everyone had a great time and it's a fun way of team building.",October 2018,Escape Rooms,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186338-d6991584-Reviews-Escape_Rooms-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.5
Pretty Pheasant,"My husband and I visited The Pheasant as a friend had recommended it and we had a thoroughly enjoyable meal in this pretty restaurant.
Our reservation was for 2.30pm and when we arrived, the car park was completely full, so we had to drive around a bit and wait for someone to leave, although I noticed when we were leaving that people had parked in the road opposite but we don't know the area.
When we got into the restaurant, we were greeted immediately and taken to a sweet little table near the indoor open fire in the middle of the restaurant (it wasn't on). We were brought our drinks very quickly and only ordered mains - I had pork and hubby had lamb - both were delicious and huge Sunday roasts served with large Yorkshire puddings, plenty of roast potatoes and veg. In fact, the meals were so filling, we couldn't manage dessert.
The service was very good and quick, but the restaurant was quite noisy with several large parties. However, it was lovely to see such a busy eatery on a Sunday afternoon.
The Pheasant is part of the Brunning & Price chain and they have another restaurant in Horley - The Fox Revived - which we prefer, but both have very welcoming atmospheres and are superb restaurants. The Pheasant is also a nice little drive out and has a lovely outside area which would be fabulous on a sunny afternoon.",April 2019,The Pheasant at Buckland,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g504181-d8739137-Reviews-The_Pheasant_at_Buckland-Reigate_Surrey_England.html,"Reigate, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Great value Mother's Day,"We visited Ye Olde Six Bells on Mother's Day for a superb 3 course meal in lovely surroundings.
I haven't been to this restaurant for ages so decided to try it for this special occasion and it really was very good.
I had the pork belly as a main and the blackcurrant prosecco cheesecake for dessert and both were excellent. My family also really enjoyed it.
They obviously had a special Mother's Day menu at just £21.95pp which was great value for money but we'll definitely be back.",March 2019,Ye Olde Six Bells,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g191265-d1653468-Reviews-Ye_Olde_Six_Bells-Horley_Surrey_England.html,"Horley, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Perfect pub!,"Despite having worked around the corner for several years, I had never visited The Albany until a few weeks ago when we had a work function there and what a great little place it is.
The service behind the bar was great and the food was superb - we had a selection of small bites. They hold quiz nights and comedy nights which a few of us said we'd be interested in going to and there's a great atmosphere. The Albany isn't a massive pub but there's plenty of seating and it's got a nice feel about it. I'll definitely be back - it's one of the nicer pubs in the area.",April 2019,The Albany,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d4102644-Reviews-The_Albany-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Good value,"My parents, sister and I visited The Orchard in January and had a fairly good meal served by a great waitress.
We'd had a long day and just wanted somewhere quick and easy to eat so popped in on our way home. We got seated immediately and the drinks were quick to arrive. The food was fine - not great but not bad - but my sisters fries weren't cooked. Our waitress took them back and brought some chips to tide us over and then the fries which were very good.
We all ordered from a special menu which was called something like 5 for £5 and to be fair, a burger and chips for a fiver (I upgraded to sweet potato fries for an extra £2) was excellent value for money.
Shame the chef sent my sister's fries out uncooked as it was very quiet in there - it was a Thursday early evening - but our waitress more than made up for it.
The Orchard is quite dark and a bit gloomy inside - we've been next to the window before - but the meal was quite good and exactly what we needed. We were in and out in around an hour so quick service too.",January 2019,The Orchard,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1869831-d2252204-Reviews-The_Orchard-Ruislip_Greater_London_England.html,"Ruislip, United Kingdom",restaurants,3.0,3.5
Service with a smile,"My friend and I often meet at the Great Portland Street branch of Pizza Express and always receive a great meal served by friendly staff.
We usually order a starter to share, a pizza each and a bottle of prosecco and have always had a great time. We usually arrived early on a Friday evening - 5.30 - 6.00pm - so it's quiet and we can choose where we want to sit and the lovely staff are always happy and friendly. The lady serving us last time was a delight and I had a little a chat with her before my friend arrived.
You always know what you're getting with Pizza Express and this is a great branch - never too crowded on a Friday night, though we usually leave around 9pm, so we can have a great catch up without anyone being too close - the tables are quite well spaced anyway - and the staff are great.

"Nice food, huge queue to pay","We had a huge amount of time to spare while we were at OR Tambo - about 5 hours - and we spent most of it in Piece a Pizza which we found to be really good.
First we ordered our drinks which came very quickly and then our food - burgers - which arrived hot, tasty and fairly quickly. I was hoping they would take longer as I know we'd be in the restaurant for about 3 hours so was hoping to style it out a bit. I did notice the table.next to us told their waiter they'd been waiting for a long time but I guess it didn't matter to us.
The staff were quite nice and brought us several drinks and we were situated perfectly to watch both the football and rugby on the TVs. Only 2 real downsides- there's a smoking area in the restaurant and although it is in it's own room, the smoke wafts round the corner so if you're sitting near the entrance you can smell it and the queue to pay is ridiculous! You get your bill and then have to get up to pay for it which would be fine if there were more tills and till assistants but the 2 tills they had on definitely weren't enough and I counted 20 people in the queue on at least 4 occasions - not ideal if you're in a hurry for your flight.",March 2019,Piece a Pizza,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g312579-d7359797-Reviews-Piece_a_Pizza-Kempton_Park_Greater_Johannesburg_Gauteng.html,"Kempton Park, South Africa",restaurants,3.0,2.5
Traditional style tapas,"Having heard great things about the Costa del Sol in Whyteleafe, my husband and I were keen to try out this new restaurant in Horley so we visited on a Thursday night with friends.
We arrived a bit early so ordered some bread which was fresh and soft and a drink. I went for the rose which was awful - they only have one choice and it's very cheap and tastes it. When our friends arrived, they had been previously so ordered prosecco for the girls (I hadn't seen it on the menu) which was much better.
We decided to order several tapas dishes - we went for 3 each which was probably a bit ambitious as the portions are quite good sized and had to have another table added to accommodate all our food. Most of the dishes were fairly tasty but there wasn't anything I found to be superb.
The staff are a bit hap-hazard, often speaking in Spanish which is quite nice and the restaurant is definitely more traditional but this all adds to the authenticity of the place. They do have a nice outside seating area which I'm sure will be used well as the summer comes along.
We loved the previous restaurant that was in this spot as it was modern, the food was good and the staff great, so I may still be slightly biased.
I was put off by the name and decor as it just sounds tacky and looks a bit cheap, but we haven't got any other Spanish restaurants in Horley and maybe this more traditional fare is just what the town needs. I wish them every success.",April 2019,Costa del Sol Tapas Bar and Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g191265-d15881314-Reviews-Costa_del_Sol_Tapas_Bar_and_Restaurant-Horley_Surrey_England.html,"Horley, United Kingdom",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Convenient for airport,"My husband and I stayed at the Road Lodge for a night when our flight home was delayed and didn't want to hang around CTI airport. It was obviously a very late decision but the hotel was ideal for our needs and the last minute emergency of the situation.
We got a cab over as we weren't sure about walking from the airport and asked the driver to stay in case we needed to go into CT central but the reception staff said there were rooms free so we went in.
Checking in was a bit of a faff as 2 staff were helping each other with 2 separate check-ins but we were given a key to a small basic but clean room on the first floor. It was all we needed.
We asked about getting dinner but that would have meant walking back through the underpass to the airport at 7pm which we didn't feel was suitable so we walked to the petrol station next to the hotel and got some of their warm food and ate in our room.
There are people hanging around the side road to the petrol station and the hotel does have a tall iron gates perimeter but it still feels very edgy. I wouldn't have gone out for food on my own and didn't want my husband to either. It's probably best if you're landing in the evening to grab something to eat in the airport and get a cab over (we paid 100rand which we know is a RIP off but you can't pay for peace of mind!)
We had an ok night's sleep - it's next to an airport after all - and paid extra for the breakfast the next morning which was fairly standard but tasty with a small selection of items.
The hotel was about £35 and the breakfast was approx £17 for both of us so it really does offer great value for money. Small and clean but not the best part of town. We walked through the underpass to the airport the following day and it was fine in the morning sun, but I wouldn't recommend it for an evening or solo female traveller.",March 2019,Road Lodge Cape Town International Airport,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g5509852-d1168946-Reviews-Road_Lodge_Cape_Town_International_Airport-Matroosfontein_Western_Cape.html,"Matroosfontein, South Africa",hotels,3.0,3.5
"Great food, great staff, great value!","We usually have a quick drink in The Flying Horse when we're flying but had a slightly longer visit in March and decided to eat and thought everything was excellent!
When we visited, it was fairly quiet - around 2pm on a Sunday - so we sat at the nice high tables and I went to the bar to order a drink. Service was quick and friendly from the chaps behind the bar and even when I took the drinks back, another member of the team checked we were ok.
We had another couple of drinks and decided to order a snack as our flight wasn't until 6.30ish. I ordered a mozzarella and pesto panini and my husband went for the nachos. They arrived quickly, hot and delicious - perfect for a pre flight snack. The price was just under £15 for both which I thought was excellent value for money. I didn't notice if the prices were more expensive than other branches but the food still represented great value for money. I like Wetherspoons because they have such a high turnover, no doubt in part to being so cheap, that the food and drink always tastes fresh.
We were in The Flying Horse for about 3 hours and during that time several members of staff checked our food was ok and that we were.

Happy Tube Travel,"I've been travelling on the London Underground (also known to Londoners as the Tube) most of my life and use it daily on weekdays for work and still think it's one of the best public transport systems I have used in the world.
Be sure to get an Oyster card as this gives quite good discounts, plus bus travel (which is a nice but slower way of seeing London) - if you're visiting London for a few days, the travel alone can add up. It's definitely the quickest way to get around London and quite easy to negotiate, though some of the stations (particularly the large ones and those in the City) have several exits which can be confusing, but there are tube maps on all the trains and land maps at the stations, which are also staffed and the teams are usually very good and helpful.
It's worth checking the TFL website to see if there are planned line closures, especially at the weekend, but there are usually alternative routes.
Most of the lines are open late into the night and some are 24 hours though again worth checking which ones they are.
Couple of tips - stand to the right on the escalators as walking is to the left and wait for people to get off the train before getting on - these will make for happy Tube travel.",March 2019,London Underground,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186338-d187536-Reviews-London_Underground-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.5
