Lovely gardens,"Lush and beautiful. Perfect for an afternoon stroll, with water features for children, sitting areas and much more.

Gorgeous,"I was pleasantly surprised by the lovely décor, the area surrounding the hotel is beautiful. I really liked the extra touches, like the flower tissue art in the bath room and the fresh warm cookies in the lobby. The rooms were nice, clean and well kept and our view out the window was serene. I was also pleasantly surprised by the breakfast bar - which included hot bacon and eggs. The staff was friendly, I would definitely stay here again.",August 2014,Hampton Inn & Suites Show Low-Pinetop,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g31356-d1143868-Reviews-Hampton_Inn_Suites_Show_Low_Pinetop-Show_Low_Arizona.html,"Show Low, Arizona",hotels,5.0,4.5
fun western atmosphere,"It felt like a trip back in time with the fun and quirky bar decorations and lots of local clientele. I had the chicken fried steak and there was enough on my plate to feed an army. The prices are a little high, but the atmosphere was a blast.",August 2014,Charlie Clark's Steakhouse,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g2623686-d515115-Reviews-Charlie_Clark_s_Steakhouse-Pinetop_Lakeside_Arizona.html,"Pinetop-Lakeside, Arizona",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Historic and fun,"We enjoyed our stay at the General Palmer, it is right in Downtown, close to all the shops and the train station. I love the history of the building & my favorite was the journal singed by previous room guests that we found in our room. I was told this hotel is haunted (a fun fact I shared with my kids, which made the stay even more excited for them). It was a nice break from large impersonal chain hotels, lots of charm.",August 2013,General Palmer Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g33397-d286533-Reviews-General_Palmer_Hotel-Durango_Colorado.html,"Durango, Colorado",hotels,4.0,4.0
Spectacular scenery & wonderful hot springs,"Ouray is one of the prettiest places on earth. The Box Canyon Lodge is located just at the edge of town, you can walk to downtown, but it is a few blocks. The rooms are basic and clean, but the hotel is nestled up to a hillside and the three different hot spring hot tubs were wonderful. Sitting in the hot tub surrounded by spectacular mountain views - it was fantastic and so relaxing. The hotel is right next tot he incredible falls (its worth the effort to go see them). We would stay here again.",August 2013,Box Canyon Lodge & Hot Springs,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g33581-d74662-Reviews-Box_Canyon_Lodge_Hot_Springs-Ouray_Colorado.html,"Ouray, Colorado",hotels,4.0,4.5
