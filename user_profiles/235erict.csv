Absolutely Wonderful!!!!,"This tour was fantastic! I knew I wanted to see a flamenco show during my visit to Spain, but I needed to understand it better in order to truly appreciate it. This tour was exactly what I needed. Plus, learning about the different nuances with the food and the tapas process proved to be a huge benefit later during our 2-week trip around Andalusia.

Our guide, Elena, was fantastic! She was extremely welcoming, personable, and she knew what she was talking about! By the end of night, all of us in the group were friends, even if only for that one evening. We had a great time while learning more than I ever expected.

Elena also gave us advice on places to eat in the various cities and towns we would be visiting during the rest of our trip (none of those cities had Devour Tours), and her suggestions were the best meals we had in Spain.

This tour was worth every penny, especially when you realize how much you eat and drink along the way, and of course the tickets to the show. I highly recommend it!",June 2019,Seville Tapas & Flamenco Tour,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g187443-d12224968-Seville_Tapas_Flamenco_Tour-Seville_Province_of_Seville_Andalucia.html,"Seville, Spain",activities,5.0,5.0
You have to here if you go to Seville,"Obviously, anyone visiting Seville will tour this site. It's a beautiful palace with amazing fountains and gardens. Alcazars in Andalusia like this one are different from the rest of Europe because of the tile work, architecture, painting design, and lack of over-the-top ornate gold decoration. It's not the same old thing you've seen in other parts of Europe.

Also, the gardens were great.

Excellent!,"This was better than the Acropolis itself. It's right across the street from the Acropolis. Historians took all the statues and sculptures from the Parthenon & other temples on the Acropolis and put them in this museum to protect them. It's very informative, organized, and well done.

We went in late July (peak season). We got there about 10:00 or so and had no wait. But as we left about 1 to 1.5 hours later, there was a huge line.

Spend 10 minutes and then head to the Ancient Agora,"Not much to see here. If you bought the combo ticket, you might as well go in it, but it's not worth more than about 10 minutes.

Part of the Ancient Agora. Excellent little museum and offers shade.,It's part of the Ancient Agora. It's the old shopping mall/market of the Agora. Lots of statues & sculptures. Shaded.

Pretty neat,"Go on Sunday at 11am. The ceremony is much more animated. It involves a small parade and 30 or 40 extra guards along with a small military marching band. The marching is very animated and in slow motion. The flamboyant uniforms and puffy balls on their shoes add a lot to the ceremony. The marching style is more of a strut than a march, almost like a peacock showing off.

It gets really hot because you have to wait several minutes for it to start, and it then takes another 15 minutes or so to finish.

Not worth going inside,"It's not worth paying to walk inside. Read about its history on the sign outside of the stadium and the walk by it and look inside of it from the outside.

One of the 3 most important things to see when you visit Athens,"This is the best thing Athens has to for visitors, in addition to the Acropolis and Acropolis Museum.

This place is great!,"Nice privately owned bar with a European feel. There were customers of of all ages from 25 to 65+. The staff was extremely friendly and knowledgeable of the beer selection. If you're looking for Miller Lite & Coors, this is not the place for you, but if you'd prefer a wide selection of imports you've never heard of and craft beers from the region and the rest of the country, you need to try this place!

There's a TV or two, but this is not a sports bar. If your goal is to watch a game with your buddies, there are better places to go. But if you want to sit around and talk, this is the place for you. They even have a wide selection of board games for you to play as well. There were couples there, groups of friends, and a handful of people there alone...and everybody seemed to get along great.

It had a social atmosphere that you don't often find, with people from different groups interacting with everyone else. The crowd wasn't the boisterous, immature type who are just tying to get drunk and obnoxious. They were the more mature, laid back type that enjoy their beer and conversation in a bar setting.

There is no food, but they'll let you bring food in. There's a fish place, a Mexican restaurant, a Subway, a pizza place, and the Chinese place in the same shopping center, and most will deliver the food to you at the bar.",October 2015,Hop Scholar Ale House,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g56701-d7653220-Reviews-Hop_Scholar_Ale_House-Spring_Texas.html,"Spring, Texas",restaurants,5.0,4.0

Good experience,"If you've never been to a Holocaust museum, you need to come see it. It's a really good experience for those who've never been to one before.

If you've been to other Holocaust or WWII museums, you probably won't be that impressed and may be better off skipping it. I've been to others that were more moving & thorough, but that's not to say this one isn't impressive.

Pleasantly surprised!,"Very interesting! Not morbid like you'd think. You never think about the customs and traditions regarding burials, but every culture & region has their own practices, and they constantly evolve. Exhibits change from time to time. I've been 3 times over the past few years, and many of the exhibits changed between each visit.

Excellent self-guided audio tour! Excellent value!,"For $30, you get the ride out to ""The Rock"" and back, access to the park, entrance into the prison, and a self-guided audio tour. I was expecting it to cost much more.

I've done countless self-guided audio tours at various places throughout America and Europe, and this one was probably the best I've ever experienced. The characters voicing the tour are guards, inmates, a warden, and some family members of those individuals. It was extremely well done and exceeded my expectations in every way.

You get to see the inside of the cells, the solitary confinement, showers, the guardrooms, the dining room, and the rec yard during the tour. You are also free to wander all over the island once the audio tour is over.

One of the inmates who'd written one of the most popular books about inmate life was there in the gift shop signing books as well, which was pretty interesting.

I loved the tour as I knew I would, but my wife loved it too even though she had been dreading it. All the adults I saw on the tour (probably a couple hundred) and just about every child over the age of 10 or so all seemed to be completely captivated the entire time.

Average,"There was really nothing special, but it's good for a quick bite for breakfast before the Alcatraz tour or a sandwich or chowder or pizza. My sandwich was practically impossible to eat because the fresh sourdough roll they use as a bun is impossible to bit through. Slicing the bread would be helpful.

But it's a pretty cool place with the bread flying all around over your head in the baskets.",June 2014,Boudin Bakery & Cafe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60713-d2537751-Reviews-Boudin_Bakery_Cafe-San_Francisco_California.html,"San Francisco, California",restaurants,3.0,4.0
"Some cool stuff in the park, but some of it costs money","It's a park. There are a few things that are pretty cool I suppose, but most most cities have nice parks and this one didn't seem that different. Lots of nice scenery, alcoves, trees, water features, etc. Many of the interesting things to see cost money just to see it, so that was weird and disappointing.",June 2014,Golden Gate Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60713-d311684-Reviews-Golden_Gate_Park-San_Francisco_California.html,"San Francisco, California",attractions,3.0,4.5

Excellent pork burrito,"We were visiting from Texas and really wanted a taste of the San Francisco food truck experience. We found a group of them circled up in a concrete playground in the North Beach area and gave them a shot. I had a pork burrito & a beef burrito from Burr-Eatery and was quite impressed. Whlie the beef burrito didn't blow me away, the pork burrito which I normally don't really like was phenomenal! Really nice guy serving them up, too.

The bacon cookie...not as awesome as it sounds,"I freakin' love bacon. We were visiting from Texas and really wanted a taste of the San Francisco food truck experience, and we luckily stumbled upon a group circled up in a concrete playground in North Beach. After eating my meal at another truck, I decided that I couldn't leave without checking out the Bacon Bacon truck since I freakin' love bacon.

Didn't live up to the hype,"I should probably write 2 reviews...one from me and one from my wife. I'd give it a 2 or 3 and my wife would give it a 5, so i'll just average it out to a low 4.

I'm not the target audience for this show. The cast was extremely talented, but it just wasn't my thing. It was reasonably entertaining I suppose, but many of the songs/skits were out-dated and awkward for that reason. Some of them could have been written a little better in my opinion as well. For the price we paid, I was not impressed.

My wife on the other hand absolutely loved it. It was one of the highlights of the trip for her.

It was kind of funny looking around at all the couples in the crowd, especially the tourists like us. The husbands all looked miserable, as if they were counting down the minutes until it was over. The wives on the other hand all seemed to be into it.

The room was overly cramped and had the feel of a comedy club...but considerably more cramped and uncomfortable. The bathroom was fantastic though. My first experience with a unisex bathroom. Seemed far more efficient than a normal bathroom.",June 2014,Beach Blanket Babylon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60713-d142394-Reviews-Beach_Blanket_Babylon-San_Francisco_California.html,"San Francisco, California",attractions,4.0,4.5

"OK, I guess","It took quite a while for a waiter to take our order, but once he did, he was awesome. Probably the best waiter on our entire 7-day trip. But again, it took over 5 minutes for him to show up.

Disappointed,"Everything seemed to be a major chain establishment. Pricey seafood restaurants are just about the only food options.

Disappointed,"Pricey seafood is the only real option for food. Burgers, hot dogs, corn dogs, snow cones, or funnel cakes would have been nice.

Interesting Place,"I'm a big barbecue fan from Texas, so I'm pretty critical, but if you're in the mood for some really good barbecue, this probably isn't the place for you. I knew what I was getting into when I went there, and I'm glad I tried it for the uniqueness factor of combining a wine bar with a barbecue joint. But for me, it just didn't work. Overpriced mediocre barbecue on nice plates and wine was just too weird for my taste.

Not bad,"My wife and I aren't big wine drinkers, and this was our first winery tour ever, so we didn't have much to compare it to until a few days later once we'd visited a few other places. The gondola ride was nice and is the main thing that sets this place apart. The tour is self-guided, so it's not very informative to a novice trying to become educated in the ways of wine, but the laid back atmosphere is welcoming to beginners like us who didn't really know what to expect. The facility and the grounds were beautiful and the staff was very friendly. There were 4 stops (I think) along the way where we got to taste different types of wine.

Overall, if you're a very knowledgeable wine drinker, there are probably better tours in the area, but it wasn't bad for a first-timer.",June 2014,Sterling Vineyards,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g32143-d144104-Reviews-Sterling_Vineyards-Calistoga_Napa_Valley_California.html,"Calistoga, California",attractions,4.0,4.0
We liked it better than Muir Woods,"We went to Armstrong on a Monday and Muir the following day. It's easy to compare the 2 after doing both back-to-back like that.

Trees/Forest: Both parks are comparable, although I think Armstrong's trees seem to be a little bigger and older.

Signs/Education: The signs and educational aspects are better and more accessible at Armstrong. Muir offers very little in the way of education about Redwood trees and the forest's history, but Armstrong is much more thorough. Plus, there are so many people at Muir, it's almost impossible to actually read the signs that are there.

Paths/Environment: The paths at Armstrong are more rustic while Muir's are more commercial. For me, the boardwalks detracted from the experience at Muir which wasn't a factor at Armstrong. You could get much closer to the trees themselves at Armstrong as well. There are also other things to see at Armstrong such as the ampitheater. The one big advantage Muir had over Armstrong was the stream, which actually had water in it compared to the one at Armstrong which was nothing more than a dry creek bed.

People/Touristy Feel: Muir is overrun with tourists. This killed the mood for me. It's hard to enjoy a stroll through the woods when there are 300 people within a 50-foot radius at all times. However, at Armstrong, there were maybe 10 other couples/families in the entire park. We practically had the entire place all to ourselves. It was great.

Facilities/Amenities: Muir wins this one hands down. There's a bathroom at Armstrong and a small visitor's center, but that's about it. Muir has a much better visitor's center, more restrooms, a place to eat, a small store, and better walking paths. With that said, this was actually a negative for us since we felt those things took away from the experience. But that's a matter of opinion that many of you may not share.

Final Verdict: I'm giving Armstrong 5 stars and Muir 4. I'd highly recommend Armstrong to anyone who has the time as they visit Sonoma...especially if you're in the area. But you should probably just go to Muir if you aren't planning to go that far north. If you are trying to choose between the two or are planning to do both, skip Muir.

Excellent tour,"My wife and I are not big wine or champagne drinkers, but we did 3 tours in Napa/Sonoma and this was our favorite. The tour guide was exceptional. Very enthusiastic, knowledgeable, entertaining, and patient. There were a couple of children in the group who had lots of silly questions, and he answered them all one by one. He turned it in to a funny and enjoyable experience for all. I wish I could remember his name so I could let his bosses know what a good job he did.

The history of the winery was fascinating, and the learning how the sparkling wine making process differs from the still wine making process was very interesting.

The guide taught us a lot about their biodynamic and organic processes which sets it apart from many of the others. The tour through the vineyard was much better than others because of the tram. You get to see the caves and finish up with a tasting as well. Overall, it was a great experience.",June 2014,Benziger Family Winery,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g32429-d143942-Reviews-Benziger_Family_Winery-Glen_Ellen_Sonoma_County_California.html,"Glen Ellen, California",attractions,5.0,4.5
Highlight of our time in San Francisco,"Dylan's Tours was truly the highlight of my trip to San Francisco. His tour focuses on areas of the city and surrounding area that is hard to reach without a car which makes it a great activity for out-of-town tourists staying in the Union Square/China Town/Nob Hill areas.

Dylan is a local who has a lot of knowledge about the history, demographics, political history, & culture of each district. You get to learn in great detail what each district is and how & why it became that way. He explains why & how Haight-Ashbury became the Rock n Roll/Hippy mecca of America...how & why San Francisco in general (and especially the Castro) has attracted such a huge gay population...how & why China Town was settled by the Chinese...and how & why the Tenderloin got its name and why is't so heavily populated with homeless people.

For me, the different neighborhoods are what makes San Francisco so unique, and his tour was one of the most fascinating and educational tours I've ever been on.

Additionally, Dylan is very easy to get along with and about as friendly as a guy can be. It's like riding around in a van with your old buddy who happens to be from there. You get to know the others in the van, too, and you get a great chance to know them a little which is a nice benefit.

My wife loved the tour because she got to see all the hot spots within the city and get a lot of great pictures. So even if you aren't as intrigued by the history of each area, you will still thoroughly enjoy this tour.",June 2014,Dylan's Tours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60713-d1444435-Reviews-Dylan_s_Tours-San_Francisco_California.html,"San Francisco, California",attractions,5.0,5.0
Great location. Great staff.,"We really enjoyed our visit. It's right across the street from the beach and only a couple of blocks from downtown Pacific Grove, so there are lots of fun activities, majestic views, and nice restaurants within walking distance.

The staff was fantastic. After trying the lady's in the visitors' center downtown who made everything in town sound so boring, I went to the front desk for some info on more local things to do. The guy gave me much better literature & maps; and more importantly his enthusiasm made everything sound so fun and exciting. His attitude and helpfulness were precisely what I needed and they couldn't have been better.

The only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is because of the noise. The walls are thin, so you can hear the light rumblings of your neighbors' TV & conversations. It wasn't enough to keep you up at night, but it can be a little distracting.

I would be happy to recommend this hotel to anyone and would gladly stay there again.",June 2014,Lovers Point Inn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g32840-d595076-Reviews-Lovers_Point_Inn-Pacific_Grove_Monterey_County_California.html,"Pacific Grove, California",hotels,4.0,3.5
Kind of laughable...,"There's a guyser shooting water up into the air every few minutes and a bunch of sad goats. If it were free, it would be worth an extra star, but it actually costs money. It really deserves only 1 star, but it was so pathetic, it gave me and my wife something to laugh about the rest of our trip...so I bumped it up to 2. I'm not even sold on it being real. Unless you have children under 10, I'd skip it.",June 2014,Old Faithful Geyser of California,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g32143-d145314-Reviews-Old_Faithful_Geyser_of_California-Calistoga_Napa_Valley_California.html,"Calistoga, California",attractions,2.0,3.0
We really enjoyed it,"This was a great change of pace from the winery tours and vineyards which can get a little monotonous after a while. It was really fascinating, and the friendly gentleman working at the information desk could not have been more friendly and helpful regarding other things to do & see in the area.

There was nothing earth-shattering about the experience, but the small fee was definitely worth it, and we thoroughly enjoyed it.",June 2014,Petrified Forest,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g32143-d116940-Reviews-Petrified_Forest-Calistoga_Napa_Valley_California.html,"Calistoga, California",attractions,4.0,4.0
Excellent experience!,"My wife & I had a great stay. While everything is actually new and modern, it all has the feel of an old family-owned inn in Europe or perhaps a Bed & Breakfast. The clawfoot tub, the old-style caged elevator, and the decorations all add to that feel in the best way.

It's very conveniently located right on the cable car line just a few short blocks from Union Square. However, we never heard any street noise in the evenings or at night, even though our windows were open all night long.

The staff was wonderful. The lady at the front desk showed an amazing amount of patience with a very confused customer on the phone, finding several ways to explain the most basic details of the hotel until the customer understood.

I would gladly recommend this hotel to anyone and would be happy to stay there again if I should ever return to San Francisco.",June 2014,Cornell Hotel de France,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d80937-Reviews-Cornell_Hotel_de_France-San_Francisco_California.html,"San Francisco, California",hotels,5.0,4.5
Great if you have more than just 2 hours,"My wife & I only had a couple of hours, and it was a dreary rainy day. We didn't have time to get out at the cathedral or at Salet. With that in mind, it was pretty mediocre.

While it was gorgeous and interesting, and I'm glad we did it since we were in the area and had a couple of hours to kill before the Eagle's Nest tour started...it's closer to the bottom on the list of my favorite things that we did during our Bavarian road trip.

However, as I said earlier, we only had about 2 hours or so. I think if we had 4 or more hours to spend at the lake so that we could get out and see the cathedral and walk around Salet or the other sites, it would've been a 5-star experience.

But if you only have 2 hours like we did, it's probably not going to be a highlight of your trip.",September 2013,Königssee,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g198481-d620490-Reviews-Konigssee-Schoenau_am_Koenigssee_Upper_Bavaria_Bavaria.html,"Schoenau am Koenigssee, Germany",attractions,3.0,4.5
"A ""Can't-Miss"" experience!!!","We booked the tour called “The Eagles Nest Historical Tour” with David & Christine Harper. I usually don’t do tours like this, but their educational approach instead of a simple sight-seeing approach seemed like something my wife & I would be interested in...and I was right! I learned more on the bus ride up the mountain than I did actually seeing the sites. The tour guide explained Hitler’s early years and how he went from a high school dropout to a homeless man to an evil dictator. She explained how he basically took over the entire mountain & all the property already there, and we got to see it all, or at least what wasn't destroyed in WWII.

The views from the Eagle's Nest are truly one of a kind. It was snowing up there (7 inches had accumulated) and was just about the most beautiful place I've ever seen.

The underground bunker system that runs throughout the mountain was awesome although they wouldn’t let us take pictures. The tour guide came in very handy in the museum since everything is written in German.

My wife and I did and saw over a dozen activities & sites during our Bavarian road trip, and this was definitely in our top 2 (possibly behind Oktoberfest). Just seeing the Eagle's Nest and the related sites on the mountain would've been absolutely fantastic, but the tour made it even better. It was well worth every penny, and I can't recommend it enough.",September 2013,Eagle’s Nest Historical Tours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187299-d2178160-Reviews-Eagle_s_Nest_Historical_Tours-Berchtesgaden_Upper_Bavaria_Bavaria.html,"Berchtesgaden, Germany",attractions,5.0,4.5
Excellent experience!,"We enjoyed our short one-night stay! The owner was very friendly and our room was very comfortable. We got had a corner room with a balcony wrapping around two walls of our room, and the views were fantastic. You could see the Ehrenberg ruins in the distance, especially after dark when they were lit up.

We had to leave very early in the morning, so we couldn't enjoy the breakfast. But we could smell it cooking, and it smelled wonderful. We can also guarantee that their bread is delivered fresh daily since we were up early enough to see it being delivered.

The owner and his wife proved to be very accommodating and flexible since we unexpectedly had to leave much earlier in the morning than we expected. Although we hadn't made arrangements with them the night before, they woke up early and checked us out of the hotel so we could get back on the road as soon as we needed.

If you are looking for a quiet and authentic taste of Reutte and the Bavarian lifestyle with pleasant views of the mountains at an affordable price, this is the place for you. But I would make sure you have a car since it is not close to any public transportation as far as I could tell.",September 2013,Pension Leuprecht,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g580114-d1604814-Reviews-Pension_Leuprecht-Reutte_Tirol_Austrian_Alps.html,"Reutte, Austria",hotels,5.0,4.5
Nice contrast to the lavish castles nearby,"The Ehrenberg Ruins served as an interesting contract to the lavish and ornate Linderhof Palace and Neuschwanstein Castle, and we thoroughly enjoyed the experience.

The hike up the trail to the ruins may be quite strenuous for some. Since we had already hiked up a few mountains earlier that day, we were a little worn out and tired, but it was worth it anyway. It was 30 minutes or so of steady uphill walking, but you can stop and rest at any time. There are several signs and maps explaining the history of the castle & its ruins, and these signs give you a chance to catch your breath if you're tired.

The views from the ruins are amazing, and you do get to crawl around on the ruins themselves.

Some of it is being restored right now, so there was a lot of construction equipment just laying around. There were also some signs and banners advertising the construction company that is restoring the ruins. This detracted from the experience quite a bit for us, but I guess that's the price you pay for maintaining 800 year old structures!!

If you have small children, be careful since there are very few hand rails and almost nothing separating you from the edge of the mountain along the trail and on the ruins. The trail is all dirt and gravel, so pushing as stroller, pushing a wheel chair, and using a cane may be impossible. But it shouldn't be a problem for most adults and well-behaved kids.

You will need a couple of hours to get up the mountain, see the ruins, and hike back down again. Also keep in mind that there are no bathroom facilities. It is truly an outdoor experience.

Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed the experience and would highly recommend it to anyone who is comfortable hiking up and back down a mountain.",September 2013,Burgenwelten Ehrenberg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g580114-d3142198-Reviews-Burgenwelten_Ehrenberg-Reutte_Tirol_Austrian_Alps.html,"Reutte, Austria",attractions,4.0,4.5
Difficult to drive to,"Our stay in the hotel was good. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. They were very helpful and always had a smile on their faces. The room was very modern and had the feel of a new hotel.

The location is good because it's very accessible by foot. Our only problem with the stay is that you must park a few blocks away, and we were unaware of this ahead of time. Many streets in Salzburg are closed off to vehicles, so driving directly to the hotel is impossible unless you know exactly what you are doing. For this reason, it took us forever to figure out how to get there even though we were only a block or two away.

If you are driving a car, I would advise you to call the hotel the day before you arrive to receive instructions on how to drop off your bags and directions to the parking garage where you are supposed to park. Had we done this, our rating would've been 4 stars instead of 3.

The only other problem we had was the smell in the lobby when we checked out. I'm not sure if was a sewage problem or the smell of their breakfast.

Overall, we would likely stay at a different hotel if we ever visit Salzburg again. But as long as you understand the parking situation ahead of time, you should be happy if you choose to stay here.",September 2013,Star Inn Hotel Premium Salzburg Gablerbrau,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g190441-d2558483-Reviews-Star_Inn_Hotel_Premium_Salzburg_Gablerbrau-Salzburg_Austrian_Alps.html,"Salzburg, Austria",hotels,3.0,4.5
You can't miss this!,"We just spent a week driving throughout Bavaria leading up to Oktoberfest, and of the dozens of things we saw and places we visited, this is easily in our top 3. It's like a canyon with 200 ft cliffs on each side, but only 30 feet wide or so and raging river flowing through it. Dozens of waterfalls everywhere. Wear a poncho, but you'll get soaked head to toe anyway. We took the cable car up and hiked down to the gorge on a beautiful trail and then through the gorge from the top. If you visit Bavaria and skip this site, you've missed out. Must be able to walk up steep hills.",September 2013,Partnachklamm,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187302-d8556393-Reviews-Partnachklamm-Garmisch_Partenkirchen_Upper_Bavaria_Bavaria.html,"Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany",attractions,5.0,4.5
Excellent Experience!,"This hotel is located on a gorgeous cobblestoned street that looks like it's in a movie about a small Bavarian village in the 1800s. We booked our room through another website, and the hotel had lost our reservation for some reason. But after showing them my confirmation email from the website, they honored my reservation and made everything right. Everyone was extremely nice and helpful, even going above and beyond by suggesting sites to see throughout Bavaria and giving me directions to a shop outside of town for affordable lederhosen since I was preparing to attend Oktoberfest later in the week.

The downstairs restaurant was not too loud for us as others have suggested. The room had a traditional Bavarian style with a nice rustic feel. There was free parking located in the back that came in extremely handy for us since we were driving. You will not be disappointed by the breakfast either!

I would highly recommend this location to anyone visiting Garmisch-Partenkirchen.",September 2013,Hotel & Gasthof Fraundorfer,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187302-d238019-Reviews-Hotel_Gasthof_Fraundorfer-Garmisch_Partenkirchen_Upper_Bavaria_Bavaria.html,"Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany",hotels,5.0,4.0
