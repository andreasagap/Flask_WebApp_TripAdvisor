Fascinating glimpse into the UN,"We visited the UN because in school, there's the MUN. When we plan our visit to NYC, it is part of our must do list. We were there just in time because of security. Do listen, one hour is probably minimum.. I might recommend a little more wiggle room more at 1hr 30min. We made it within 7 minutes of our tour starting at 9:45a. The guides showed us the actual assembly rooms. One of the room was in session. Amazing to see things work in real time. The actual funcion of UN and how effective it is can be up for debate. But, the tour itself is not part of that debate. It is a place to showcase UN and its signficance. If you are interested in history and humanitarianism, please visit.

"Despite the rain, it is still five stars!","Hey Ziggy..
I am sure you remember us!! We loved all your corny jokes and all the food places you brought us to. We will be your first 5 star rating for a tour in the RAIN!
That pastrami is rated higher than Katz Deli in our eyes!! (readers: he takes people to different places all the time.. maybe he saved the best just for us!!) We tried new food that we wouldn't have tried before. All of them tasted nice! The tour was coming to an end and Ziggy was saying his kids' favorite location was right there. So, bonus on that one!

"Great place to call ""home"" for our trip to NYC","This is our first time visiting NYC. Glad we found this hotel. Location is just right for us, walk to Time Square, theatre district, Penn station, subway entrances, and grocery. It was far enough that we did not see lots of crowds loitering around. The free breakfast came in really handy every morning, though it is kind of crowded. They do have a take away box that you can box your breakfast in and eat in your room, if you wish. Many nights we bought take out and eat at the tables on the first floor to save money. The managment was nice and attentive. They even have services to help us call for car service at the end of our trip. That was really nice. Great place to use as base for a visit.

A great little Disney in Hong Kong,"This is my second visit to Hong Kong Disney. I remember it being not remarkable the first time (many years ago). But, this time, I think it is worth the price of admission and a great getaway. There's several Hong Kong only rides that you have to do.

Must see icon.,"This is a must see if you are in Rome. If you are really short on time or don't want to pay $$, you can view it from the outside. For most people, going in is essential. Make sure you do order your tickets online. I did not want the hassel of doing that, so I ended up hiring a private guide for our family of 6. It was WELL worth it -- Just for skipping the lines! Because it is a tour, we got to line up in the ""tour"" side. It went so much faster than the regular line. By the time we passed through the turnstile, it was literally 10 people deep inside the gates. There were lines outside the gates!

Great learning and touring experience,"This is my second time and family's first time to visit Stonehendge, Bath, and Avebury. I really researched a lot prior to signing up. Since I remember my last tour (with another smaller company), I really wanted an indepth explaination of these historic locations. I felt I did not learn much from my last trip. That is what this tour is about. The pick up location was very easy to find, the mini bus was great, and we had a great time! In the beginning, kids were just meh (about a learning tour) but by the end of the trip, they were asking lots of questions. Even my husband was asking lots of questions! With a smaller tour group, comparable prices (to the bigger tours), and personalized service, I am recommending this tour to anyone! Not to mention, we found the best fish and chip, recommended by the guide.

customized tour for family,"We booked through greeking.me for our family's trip in Greece. I am usually the do-it yourself vacationer but I was not sure I could tackle the language and logistics of Athens and its outside locations. The airport pick up was very prompt and very easy. The pickup time for the tour was moved up to 8am instead of 9am because the guides recommended it. I agree!! It made the entire trip less crowded. By the time we were almost done, most of the tourists starts to pour into the site. So, great advice by the agency. Our guide, Evita, was very knowlegeable and nice. Great stories that gave us the background on the ancient sites. Recommend you to hire a guide, it will add so much more to your visit. Our trip fell on a major holiday in Greece. So, the town was mostly closed. A lot of the shops ""not in the tourist area"" were closed. But, there were plenty of restaurants still open. The bonus is no traffic! Our second guide, Vivi, was also very knowlegable. You can tell she is very passionate about the monuments. Actually, both guides are still involved in museum or archeology in the off season, making them professionals in their own right.
The only thing I wished was a list of time for pick up fromt the agency beforehand. I need my list of things.. :) Either case, we had no problem in figuring out when and where. All the drivers and guides were very helpful and courteous.
We had great recommendations for restaurants.

"Wonderful visit, don’t miss this","Today we had a great visit at Ostia Antica. Per previous posters, it was easy to get to from Rome. Use metro to change onto metro B, at pyramid, a sign directs you to a train to Ostia. The station to get off is Ostia Antica. Very small station, but has automatic tickets for buying return ticket. I pre-purchased both trips though. The signs are very clear, go across the walk way and you are there. Even a yellow walk path was drawn. The facilities seems to be newly renovated, an air conditioned ticket area, nice and clean bathroom before entrance. I made an appointment for a staff guide on their website. Stephanie was SO knowledgeable. She worked on escavating the site. Inexpensive for what you get. Today was REALLY hot, but there are shades from trees here and there. Bring hats. There is one water faucet that we found inside. At almost the end of the park, there is a new looking facility for food, gifts, and bathrooms. Really nicely air conditioning and everything was clean. The food was very reason priced and very tasty. Next to the cafeteria is a small museum with statues they found at the sites. Well air conditioned and free. I know I mentioned air conditioning a lot, but when we got back into the city, I saw temp to be 40! The archeological treasures at the site is pretty amazing. Original mosaic floor, home, streets, temples.. on and on.. There were plenty of other tourists that came to visit but with the size of the place, you feel like you are one of the few people on site. Bring good walking shoes because you will be walking on original Roman paths. Really recommend coming here. Just wish our temperature were slightly better.

Awesome golf car tour with Valerio,"We just finished our tour of Rome on a golf cart with Valerio. He was full of patience and stories to keep kids occupied. We really enjoyed this tour. 7 hours felt short. We zigzagged all around Rome, outside and inside the city walls. We asked to see more out of the city center things since we could walk to more centrally located places. We were surprised with some cool churches and fun facts that were very unique and unexpected (don’t want to spoil it). We ate at one of Valerio’s favorite restaurant for lunch(great choice). All the dishes were great. Our kids love the steaks and pastas - everything was gone in a few minutes! The portions were not little. Best part of all, kids all loved the tour.

After the upper gallery, we quickly browsed through the second, lower gallery. Even with that, it took 2 hours to walk through. If you have younger kids, focus on something and skip some galleries.

Good use of transportation,"It was very extensive. Easy to use. Must be able to read map/line.. match the station name. I would not recommend for people who might easily get confused or lost. There's a lot of trains/tracks/connection ways to get lost there.
For me, I think it was great. For my parents, they will totally get lost.
Try to get a Pasmo card (there are several different types and all will work) because it will make your life so much easier traveling. You really don't need to know where you need to go and just beep in. After you get to your destination (maybe with many mistakes) just beep out. No worry. If you are low on $, just charge it on the automatic addition machines.
The machines have English on them. Most big stations have information booth so use them if you need them.

"Hike up/down the hill in pouring rain. Stil, fun time.","We had planned to visit this location during our trip but it happen to be raining, BIG time --Typhoon hitting the other side of the island big.. For us, rain is on and off but pouring at times. Check your weather forecast! It is a good 20 min uphill hike all the way to the top. Some locations needs repair but not dangerous. It is winding up the mountrain like a snake. There are rest benches with overhead plastic roofs so we rested and hid from the rain. Near the top, there's an airconditioned rest area. You can see the last set of stairs to the sanctuary park. There is a little swing set and a slide there. Good for kids but worthless in the rain. The monkeys were so cute. They are well cared for. Must spent the $ to feed the monkey!! If you think 2 bags of food, then prepare to buy 5! We saw lots of mommy and baby pairs. Must go if you have kids who love animals. We stayed much longer than expected. Be careful of the time, you cannot enter pass 4:30p. It does take time to go up the mountain.

"Must go if you have kids, they will love it","We always go to the park each time we visit Taipei. Must go!
The amusement park has 13 rides of various levels of ""scariness."" Limited by your height, kids can enjoy fun rides like tea cups, flying dragon, and circular swings. It is like getting Disneyland type of rides (minus the theme) for like 50cents each ride! How can you beat that?!
Even on a hot day (which is most of the summer) we enjoy ourselves there. Go to the rides and rest in the food court. Go play awhile and then go into the arcade room.
They have a little slide playround and a sand pit too. Bring your own shovels. They have a little feet wash right next to the sand pit.
Bring a water bottle for water refill. Or buy cold water from 7-11.
The entrance is 30 NT. It is free after 4p in the summer time and open till 8p.
We did both early and later entry. If you are hesitant because of the heat, go after 4p.
Most people are locals.
Bring your EasyCard to debit all your rides.

Great eating at Kaiten sushi,"Asked the front desk for a recommendation for a kaiten sushi near our hotel. Very well advertised by Tripadvisor because the long queue was mostly tourists. The food was excellent. Must try Chawamushi ( Japanese savory custard). I know, you say, it is not sushi. But, you are getting the inside scoop! It is excellent, even my kids who does not like eggs will eat these little beauties! We tried many different sushi. Try the seasonal dishes, they are great. They do accept credit cards.

We got the first appt at 9am. 10 and 11 were all booked by the time we look. So, plan ahead. A small group goes in at a time, maybe 10-15? The docent was very informative of the cave's history. Kids loved the different formations and their names. You walk in between formations. There are lots of steps but very doable.

They messed up our reservation. NO rooms for us!,"It was the worse experience one can imagine.
First, we followed the rules and did not book this hotel due to the two day minimum policy and booked a neighboring hotel. Since our family is staying here, I contacted the hotel directly and left information in case there are openings at the hotel. Thursday before the trip, a male worker at 3pm PST called and said two rooms were cleared for us to stay for one night. One room is an executive king with sofa bed and one is one king room. I asked the price and were quoted $180 and $160 respectively. This was all okay~ Then, I cancelled our reservation for a near by hotel.
Finally, we drove all the way and arrived around 7pm. The attendant cannot find our reservation, which was clearly given to me (87643817). Somehow, the reservation was never made properly, leaving me with 7 people, including 4 kids and a senior, without a place to stay for the night during memorial weekend. The attendant just said she contacted the manager and cannot do anything for us.
By the way, a neighboring hotel's attendant, upon asking if there's openings for the night, gladly gave us more hotel listings around the area so we can ask local hotels around the area. In tehe end, everywhere was booked and we called over 6 different hotels. We were low on batteries on our cell phones and she offered to have us charge the phones there!
Not the Holiday Inn Express! Why not?! You are the ones who messed up the reservation and did not even help!
Over all the years of traveling, I have never ever had a reservation fell out like that. This is really horrible experience.
We ended up with a Holiday Inn Express about 30 min away. The attendants were kind and nice. However, there were leftover hairs on the sofa and inside beddings of the rooms we ended up staying.
I stayed with Holiday Inn Express prior but this experience is REALLY bad. From the service to the actual room, nothing seem to be correct. I am sorry that this was my experience. But, the corporate office for Holiday Inn Express needs to know. No wonder I am a member with a competitive hotel chain and not with Holiday Inn.",May 2015,Holiday Inn Express & Suites Hot Springs,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60856-d7279109-Reviews-Holiday_Inn_Express_Suites_Hot_Springs-Hot_Springs_Arkansas.html,"Hot Springs, Arkansas",hotels,1.0,4.5
