Must Visit!,"I would recommend a visit to Pearl Harbour, especially the U.S.S Arizona Memorial. We purchased online next day tickets for $1 a ticket to visit the memorial. There are various packages but they sell out fast so be sure to go in at 7:00 AM Hawaii time the day before you want to visit. There are other ways to get tickets as well but I can't speak to that.
Once we arrived, it took several minutes to find parking but it was quick and easy to get our tickets afterwards. You cannot bring purses or bags onto the site unless they are clear so we just carried our phones, camera and money. We had some time to walk around the property before meeting our group at the theatre for a 30 minute film about Pearl Harbour and the war. The film was very informative. Next, it was a short boat ride to the memorial site, where we had about 15 minutes to walk around, reading displays, viewing the memorial wall and of course viewing the sunken battleship from above. Upon our return to shore, there was a great souvenir shop and more displays to see. The tour itself takes 75 minutes but you will want some more time either before or after to explore the area.",February 2020,USS Arizona Package,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g29222-d12955290-USS_Arizona_Package-Oahu_Hawaii.html,"Oahu, Hawaii",activities,4.0,4.5
Nice store!,"We stopped here to shop in the store, which offers free samples of Kona coffee and their food products, including flavoured macadamia nuts, nut butters, hot sauces, etc. Delicious! We had to buy some to bring home! This is a great place to buy other souvenirs as well. I cannot comment on the farm tour itself but it is located in a very scenic area of the island, close to Kualoa Ranch.",February 2020,Tropical Farms Macadamia Nut Farm and Farm Tour,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60653-d1059208-Reviews-Tropical_Farms_Macadamia_Nut_Farm_and_Farm_Tour-Kaneohe_Oahu_Hawaii.html,"Oahu, Hawaii",attractions,4.0,4.5
Best spot on the leeward side of the island!,"We found this beach at the end of the road on the leeward side of the island. The whole area is beautiful with mountains on one side and the ocean on the other. The waves were huge the day we visited and boogie boarders were loving it! It was a bit scary to go swimming but we enjoyed watching the waves and the people playing in them. It was a weekend so there were lots of people, including locals, having picnics and hanging out. The beach is so long we had a decent amount of space to ourselves.",February 2020,Yokohama Bay,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g6437170-d153925-Reviews-Yokohama_Bay-Makaha_Oahu_Hawaii.html,"Oahu, Hawaii",attractions,5.0,4.5
Beautiful Lagoon # 2,"My husband and I visited lagoon # 2, which was beautiful, with clear, calm water and a sandy beach. Great area for swimming and for families with kids. I snorkeled here and there were a few fish to see, but it wasn't as good as other areas on the island. Parking can be difficult to find. Not too far from Waikiki.

Yummy Mexican food & drink,"We walked by this place when we arrived in Waikiki. It looked inviting, with brightly coloured lights, and outdoor patio seating.

Nice touristy place to visit,"Yes it's very touristy BUT we still enjoyed seeing where Dole grows its pineapples and other crops, as well as learning about this process. We paid $11.50 each and waited a half hour to take the 22 minute train tour of the fields. There was also a commentary so we learned lots. You can also take a garden tour, but it didn't seem worth it and a maze tour, which was closed the day we visited. We enjoyed the Dole whip, which was the best pineapple-flavoured soft serve! The restaurant serves various food and drinks and the store sells many pineapple themed (and other) products and souvenirs. It's not a cheap place to visit but I'd still recommend visiting for a couple of hours.",February 2020,Dole Plantation,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60659-d105817-Reviews-Dole_Plantation-Wahiawa_Oahu_Hawaii.html,"Oahu, Hawaii",attractions,4.0,3.5
Great views of Kaneohe Bay!,"Drive to the lookout for great panoramic views of Kaneohe and it's Bay. You will have to pay $3 to park here, which seems a bit steep for the quick stop you will make.

Nice beach,"My husband and I visited this beach at Turtle Bay Resort a couple of times and found the beach to be nice and the water relatively calm compared to other north shore beaches this time of year. Anyone can visit the beach, not just the resort guests and it is free. Kids played in the water and I was even able to go snorkeling, although there are better places to snorkel on the island (Shark's Cove and Hanauma Bay). Nice place to relax and swim and great for families.

Awesome Evening!,"My husband and I enjoyed this small group luau with 40 of us, including a wedding party! We were welcomed by our hosts, given a lei made from nuts and 2 complimentary drinks for the night per person (additional drinks for a small fee). The mai tai was great!
We were provided with a lot of information about Polynesian cultures and the beautiful Nutridge Estate, which overlooks Honolulu. There were 3 beautiful female dancers and 3 male entertainers, including the hilarious cousin Reno, the fun Boggie Boogie and the talented Koko. They danced for us, taught us a hula dance, and a Polynesian bowling game, made us bracelets & headbands out of leaves and prepared us a delicious meal! We also had the opportunity to participate in preparing sweet potatoes to eat!

Jurassic Valley!,"We booked the Premier Movie Set Tour online in advance and are glad we did! The ranch, located on the scenic windward east coast of Oahu, was easy to find. We picked up our tickets and looked around at the displays while waiting for our tour to begin.
I think there were 8 of us who boarded the small van for the 2.5 hour tour. The van was air-conditioned and comfortable. Our driver took us all around the property, sharing information about the ranch and movies and tv shows that were filmed here. It's a very beautiful area! And it was amazing to see all the filming locations and props! My favourite stops were at the Idonimus Rex pen in Jurassic World, the log they hid behind in Jurassic Park, and the boneyard from Kong: Skull Island. They also have a restaurant serving their products. The burger I had was just OK. There are many souvenirs for sale at the gift shop.",February 2020,Kualoa Ranch,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60653-d108380-Reviews-Kualoa_Ranch-Kaneohe_Oahu_Hawaii.html,"Oahu, Hawaii",attractions,5.0,4.5

Turtles!,"We heard you could spot green sea turtles here and luckily we did! We saw 5 turtles on the beach; 2 of which we saw crawl their way out of the ocean and onto the sandy beach! I saw another turtle while snorkeling in the water, however it was a bit too rough for good snorkeling the day we visited. The long, sandy beach is also a great place to relax and watch surfers at times.

Snorkeling!,"Loved snorkeling here! Easy to access, free, & lots of rocks and fish! The north shore of Oahu is beautiful and full of beaches. Stop here if you have children or are looking for a place to snorkel. The sheltered lagoon usually has calm, shallow waters, perfect for swimming and snorkeling! The beach is sandy but somewhat small compared to others in the area.

Snorkeling Heaven!,"This was one of the best snorkeling experiences I've ever had and I've had several! Yes, this is a popular place and you do pay to visit but we never felt overcrowded. The site was well organized, with a short mandatory video everyone must view to ensure the safety of visitors and the preservation of the reef. There is lots of parking, a store, washroom facilities and food for sale, however most of the facilities are located uphill from the beach. You can pay $2.50 per person for all day shuttle transportation between the beach and facilities or you can walk. Parking costs $1 and the entrance fee is $7.50 per person.
The beach is large and beautiful and the reef is just a short distance from shore so that anyone can easily reach it. The fish variety is great and the fish are very large.

Best way to swim with sharks!,"I booked this tour online and I'm so glad I did! We had the best morning with these guys! We were greeted in the harbour by 3 crew, the captain, photographer and our guide in the water. We were provided with all the information we would need to know and I was immediately at ease.
It took only a few minutes for our group of 6 to travel offshore to the area where we would swim. It was easy getting into the water, which was fairly calm when we went. Within minutes, we were approached by sandbar and Galapagos sharks. And by approached I mean they slowly swam towards us but kept their distance. They were close enough to see but everyone felt safe. It was actually a very peaceful experience! Our guide Kyle was great! He made sure we were safe at all times and he was able to distinguish between the types of sharks. I highly recommend booking with this company!

OK for a Night,"If you want to be in the busy city, then the location of this hotel is decent; near the beach, many restaurants and shops. There is a parking garage where you pay I think $30 USD per night, however it was full when we arrived so we had to find another parking garage, about a 5 minute walk from the hotel.
The room was large and the bed was comfortable but everything else was sub par. The couch had large stains and the room looked old. There is also construction next to the hotel, which we could hear in the morning. The free breakfast buffet was just OK. They had toast, scrambled eggs, fruit, pancakes, noodles, some meat and coffee and warm water to drink.

Beautiful island but some issues with tour,"I booked this tour online but did not realize that we would not have enough time to complete the tour because of our cruise ship departure time. I thought our ship was in port for long enough but did not account for the long 30 minute walk to the meeting location then the hour wait for people who had booked the tour but did not show!
When we finally boarded the hydrofoil ferry, it took 50 minutes to get to Capri. You don't get a good view from the hydrofoil, so we decided to purchase tickets to take a boat tour around Capri. Im glad we did because this was the highlight of the day!
After the boat tour, we waited a few minutes for a bus, which brought us to the town of Anacapri. It was a nice town with an excellent view of the harbour and town of Capri below. We enjoyed the included lunch and had bruschetta, pizza and ice cream. It was filling! We only had to pay if we wanted a drink.
We walked around Anacapri, then took the bus back to Capri. Unfortunately for my husband and I, we had to head back to Naples at this time. Our guide was amazing! Not only did she think to ask us when our ship departed before the tour started, but she also knew when we would need to return and purchased the appropriate tickets AND even walked us right back to the hydrofoil in Capri, while giving the rest of the group free time to explore Capri. We cannot praise her enough! Unfortunately we forgot her name!

Great small group tour of Florence & Pisa!,"We booked a small group tour (8 of us) with people we met on our cruise ship. There was plenty of communication with staff from this company via e-mail and we were provided with detailed information about what to expect during our tour.
Our driver met us on time and very close to the cruise port in Livorno. He drove us to Florence and we stopped to take photos at Piazzale Michelangelo, which provides a great view of Florence. Next, he dropped us off to meet our guide. We were provided with audio devices so we could hear our guide at all times as we walked around the central area of Florence to see the Ponte Vecchio, Palazzo Vecchio, and Piazza del Duomo with the massive and beautiful cathedral of Florence. There was not too much walking and the pace was just right. We were provided with lots of information about the sites we saw and then provided with a couple hours of free time to explore on our own or eat. Alternatively you could pay extra to visit the Galleria dell'Accademia museum to see Michelangelo's statue of David, etc.
Our driver met up with us after to drive us to Pisa, where we were dropped off close to the leaning tower and given 1 hour to explore on our own. This was plenty of time to see the tower and take your photos, shop for souvenirs and eat some gelato.

Just OK,"I love swimming but did not love my visit here. A taxi dropped us off in the parking lot above St. Peter's Pool and we walked down the steep pathway. You can also get here by boat from Marsaxlokk, which would save you the climb down and back up, although it looked a little challenging getting out of the boats.
Even though we visited in October, it was very crowded here and difficult to find a spot to sit. The water was refreshing and people seemed to have fun jumping in off the cliffs. There is a rocky staircase you could use but bring water shoes because it is slippery. I actually slipped and fell getting out.

When my husband and I arrived in Chania on our cruise ship, we were greeted by our driver Xristos, close to the port. Xristos was friendly and showed us some great areas that we had not even considered. I was a bit disappointed that we did not see the sites we had mentioned to Lefteris, but that was just because we didn't have the time.
We did enjoy the stops we made. You should know that this is a taxi service so we were dropped off at various stops and explored on our own. We visited a monastery, which was popular and crowded but still beautiful. We also visited a quiet park with a fantastic view of Chania. Next we stopped at the old market in Chania, which was full of restaurants and souvenir stores, and the old harbour, which had restaurants, etc. We ended with a drive through some small villages, with Xristos sharing some information about the area.

Great Private Tour of Delos & Mykonos Town!,"My husband and I joined a group of 12 others from our cruise ship for a Custom Tour: Delos Island + Food-on-Foot in Mykonos w/ walking tour.
We met our fantastic guide Antonis near the Delos ferry, which was a bit of a walk from where our cruise ship docked but close to where the cruise ships tender and also right next to where you can take the water taxi.
Antonis had our tickets for the ferry and we soon boarded for the 30 minute ride to Delos, a small island rich in ancient ruins and history, which Antonis shared with us. The 2.5 hours on the island was the perfect amount of time to see the ruins with a short stop in the museum. There is quite a bit left to the ruins, which is neat to see. I also found it interesting to see the many cats here!
After returning to Mykonos Town, we commenced a walking tour of the area, with Antonis sharing information along the way. Mykonos Town is so beautiful! I loved the food stops as well. Antonis brought us to an old bakery that had the BEST baklava and spanikopita, along with other yummy looking baked goods! There was also a stop at a store selling olive products, spices, etc. and we were able to sample so many delicious foods. Our tour ended at a restaurant where we enjoyed greek salad and wine.

The craters of Silvestri are two inactive craters formed as a result of the Mount Etna eruption of 1892. They are about 1900 meters above sea level, but you could reach a higher elevation if you want. We were satisfied to spend an hour or so here walking around the craters.

Our guide and driver were waiting for us on arrival and our group was small in size (8 of us). Cecilia was our guide and she was very knowledgeable, friendly and funny. She was so nice, she even gave us cookies!
The drive to Mount Etna was a bit long but worth it. Cecilia gave us lots of information along the way and when we arrived, we had lots of time to explore a crater on the volcano, which was really great! We even had extra time to stop at a shop at the base of the volcano, where we had free samples of flavoured olive oils, wines, limoncello, olives, honey, etc.

Just OK unless you're a history buff,"Stopped here for about 20 minutes during a tour of Athens. It's worth a quick visit if you really enjoy history and visiting ancient ruins but there isn't much to see.

Must Visit in Athens!,"You must visit the Acropolis when in Athens! Go early to beat the crowd. When we visited in October, we noticed that the crowd really grew around 10 am. The climb up isn't as difficult as I imagined. There is ongoing construction work being done on the Parthenon but you can still enjoy your visit here.

Private Tour of Athens and Corinth,"We joined a small group from our cruise ship to tour Athens and Corinth and had a great day! Our guide was easy to find upon arrival at the cruise port. The vehicle was clean and comfortable. Our driver and guide both did a great job!
Our guide Sophia walked with us around the Acropolis and Temple of Olympian Zeus in Athens and provided us with lots of information about these sites, as well as the other sites we saw during our drive.
After visiting Athens, we drove to Corinth and had a delicious lunch at a restaurant our driver and guide brought us to. Corinth was such a nice small town; I wish we had more time to explore! The ancient ruins here were nice to see; much less busy than the Acropolis in Athens but equally interesting. We also had a quick stop at a store and the Corinthian canal or Isthmus canal that connects the Saronic Sea and the Corinthian Sea.",October 2019,H.P.

Beautiful Beach,"I visited this beach during a cruise visit to Santorini. It was uncrowded, although I did visit late in the afternoon in October. The water was cool but refreshing and it was fun to snorkel around the many rocks to see the fish here. The red colour rocks are also neat. You do have to walk 15 minutes to get here from the parking lot and it is not an easy walk, as you will have to climb uphill and downhill over rocks. Still, you don't have to be in great shape to make the walk.",October 2019,Red Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1189834-d641334-Reviews-Red_Beach-Akrotiri_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",attractions,4.0,3.5
"Great service, food & atmosphere!","Our tour guide recommended eating dinner here and we're glad we did! Located on/across from the black volcanic beach, the location is a lovely place for cocktails or a romantic dinner. It was very quiet here when we visited, which was nice. The service was great; we were served quickly. We enjoyed the bread basket and dips and tzatziki dip, and I enjoyed my chicken souvlaki and greek salad. My husband also enjoyed his vegetarian dish. Also, there was a free chocolate dessert and it was very yummy!",October 2019,Forty One,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g657830-d8552123-Reviews-Forty_One-Perivolos_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Best way to get to/from Fira from Cruise Ship,"We arrived in the port of Fira by cruise ship. After a short tender boat ride to the shore, we waited in line for the cable car for 30 minutes. The ride up the cliff side is very fast, approximately 2 minutes, but not scary in my opinion.
You could also walk or ride a donkey up, although I hear this can be dangerous, plus poor donkeys! There are also people selling tours by boat from Fira to Oia and back, which could be good if that is the only place you want to visit.
Instead, I would recommend using the cable car and exploring the whole island by car!",October 2019,Santorini Cable Car,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g482942-d10336407-Reviews-Santorini_Cable_Car-Fira_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.0
Best Tour of our Vacation!,"My husband and I booked a 7-Hour Private Tailor Made tour. Our driver/guide Petros P was waiting for us at the top cable car exit when we arrived. From here, we set out to explore the island, following an itinerary we created, with input from Petros along the way.
We started with a visit to picturesque Oia, where Petros showed us around and took our picture. Such a beautiful village! We also enjoyed the less crowded areas of the island. We stopped for photos in Imerovigli and Firostefani before visiting Venetsanos Winery. Before going inside, Petros showed us some grape bushes and fig and pistachio trees. Then we had time alone to enjoy a wine tasting and snack with the best view of the sea!
When we met up with Petros again, he surprised us with baklava, which I had told him I loved. Such a nice surprise!
Our next stop was at the Red beach for swimming and snorkelling. The red cliffs were cool to see and the water was refreshing. The snorkelling was OK; there were fish to see. Next we drove to the highest point on the island at Prophet Elias to view the sunset. Finally, we ate at a lovely restaurant (Forty One) on the black beach, which was recommended to us by Petros. After dinner, we were dropped off near the cable car station and Petros walked us right to the station. We were back at our cruise ship at the perfect time.
Tip: Bring extra cash for the winery and dinner (if you choose these options).
Thank-you to Petros, who was welcoming, funny, and knowledgeable about the island of Santorini!",October 2019,Santorini Road Trips,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189433-d10333367-Reviews-Santorini_Road_Trips-Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0

"Excellent Tour of the Colosseum, Palatine Hill & Roman Forum","We took the Colosseum Underground & Ancient Rome Tour with a small group of 4 other people. I would definitely recommend this tour that includes a guided visit to the underground area of the colosseum, which is a less often visited area you can only access with a guide.
This tour was easy to book online. Our guide was waiting exactly where we were told she would be (outside the metro station). From there, it was a short walk to the colosseum and there was no waiting to get inside. Our guide provided us with so much information that was actually interesting!
We also visited the main floor area and climbed up to the seating area of the colosseum before moving onto Palatine Hill. The climb up the hill was not too difficult and the view of the Forum and area was the best! We saw some interesting ruins of former palaces and even saw a rabbit on the hill before going down to see the Forum.

Best of Rome & Vatican Tours,"My husband and I went on 2 small group tours with City Wonders and are glad we did!
The Best of Rome tour was a 2.5 hour easy walking tour starting at the Spanish Steps, near the metro station. Our guide ensured our audio equipment was working properly before we started our tour. We visited the Trevi Fountain, Pantheon, another church, and ended at Piazza Navona, after a stop for gelato, which was included in the tour price. We were able to see the main attractions in central Rome with a guide who was friendly and very knowledgeable, providing us with lots of information about the attractions and sites we saw along the way.
We also had a great guide for our Vatican City tour! We were able to find the guide just outside of the Vatican Museum and within a few minutes, we entered the museum, skipping the long line. Our guide provided us with tons of information during the tour. The tour ended inside St. Peter's Basilica, giving us additional time to explore the basilica and St. Peter's Square on our own.",October 2019,City Wonders,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187791-d779740-Reviews-City_Wonders-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",attractions,5.0,5.0
Great day touring Rhodes!,"My husband and I spent a day in Rhodes during a cruise and enjoyed a private 5 hour tour with our driver/guide Stathis, who was friendly and knowledgeable. He met us at the cruise port on time, then we drove around the island, visiting the sites we wanted to see. We also made a stop at a pottery and olive oil factory, as suggested by Stathis, which was nice. We purchased some great souvenirs at these stores and saw a pottery demonstration!
We also visited the old harbour, a Greek Orthodox Church, and enjoyed the view of Rhodes Town. We stopped at Lindos for an hour. This town is scenic but crowded with tourists.My favourite stop was at Anthony Quinn Bay, a beautiful rocky beach with clear water and decent snorkelling, as well as other water sports. Nicholas Rhodes also greeted us here, which was nice. Finally, Stathis dropped us off near the gate to the old town of Rhodes, near the cruise port, and explained the pathway we should follow to return to our ship.

Must See!,"I never get tired of seeing this incredible, large fountain. Sure the crowds are annoying (less so if you come very early I am told), but it is definitely something you want to see either on your own or as part of a tour.

Romantic Suite,"My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights during our honeymoon and had a great stay! The best part was the large 2 person jacuzzi tub in our room!
We had some trouble finding this place since our taxi could not drive on this street and there is no signage outside, just the building number. Once inside the building, we had to ask someone how to find the hotel because there were multiple floors with different businesses.
Once we found the place, the staff were very pleasant and helpful and our room was lovely! The bed was large and comfortable, especially when compared to other places I have stayed in Europe. The shower was great and there was a TV, mini fridge, etc.
You will find plenty of shops and restaurants in this area and can walk to many of Rome's attractions or walk 5-10 minutes to the metro station, which is next to the Spanish Steps.
The staff were very helpful the morning we left. Since we left for a tour before the front desk staff arrived at 8:30 am and returned after the 11 am check-out time, we made arrangements for staff to move our packed bags from our room to a luggage storage area while we were out.
