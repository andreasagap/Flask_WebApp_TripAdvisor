"Slow service, bad food, go elsewhere","We went yesterday (Thursday) for lunch. When we arrived, only two other tables were filled. We thought it would be safe and quick.

Best location for Hollywood Studios,"We chose to stay here so we could walk to HS early in the morning to get in the que for Rise of the Resistance. This is the closest walkable hotel to HS and even closer to Epcot. We thoroughly enjoyed the feel of the resort. The common areas are beautifully themed.

Excellent Service!,"My husband and I wanted to bike the 100 miles from Key Largo to Key West. I found this company on tripadvisor and the reviews were accurate. I called Patrick months in advance and rented two hybrid bicycles and panniers. We communicated a few times just before the trip. He delivered bikes to our hotel in Key Largo along with helmets, extra tubes, pump, and lock. We did not have a car or extra luggage. We biked Key Largo to Marathon one day. Rested one day.

Disappointing Resort,"My husband is a diamond level with Hilton and below you can see the view from our room. It was the roof and air conditioning unit. We have never had such a poor view at any hotel! Besides that, the room was musty and old. I have another photo of the furniture in the room. It was like something from my dorm room in the 90s. They told us there were no diamond upgrades available, but online it appeared they had plenty of rooms...and any other room would have been an upgrade! On the second night, security came two times to the room beside us where there was quite the party. The next morning we again requested an upgrade and they found us a room with a better view (see photo below). The room was just ok. I love historic hotels, but they need to be maintained. I have never stayed in a Waldorf Astoria or even a Hilton that was so poor. The beach/pool area is great, but the Courtyard in Marathon and the Marriott in Key Largo is just as good or better. For what you pay to stay here, it should be significantly better than this! Hilton and Waldorf should remove this hotel from their inventory.

Excellent property with spacious villas,"We are annual passholders but usually do not stay on property. We splurged with this visit for our kids. The one bedroom villa boasts two full baths and two fold out beds in the living room. This meant our two children didn't need to share a bed and they didn't need to share a bath with us! I read that Kidani villa rooms are the largest on property. They are the most spacious of any villa we have ever occupied - on or off Disney property! My only complaint was the lack of animals. We paid extra for a savannah view room, which I thought would have animals grazing on the savannah. However, we saw very few animals...some days we didn't see any animals at all from our room! That was very disappointing! I would suggest staying there but don't pay extra for the savannah view.

Three generations snorkel and kayak cruise excursion,"Like many of you we found this gem on Trip advisor. From the initial email with Jennie, the owner, they were ultra organized and responded quickly. We booked this for our 3 generation family trip for 10 people - my parents (age 70 and 74 and physically fit for their age), my sister and I and our husbands, and our children ranging from 10-18. No one had any difficulty with any of these activities.

We met the driver at the dock (3 minute walk from cruise ship). The bus ride was comfortable and informative.

Upon arrival at Conrad and Jennie's home, we quickly boarded the motorboat and set off on a beautiful ride to kayak spot. After kayaking, we rode to Bird island for short but steep 5 minute walk to the top. Then we chose to ride 2 minutes to snorkel spot and snorkel. Some opted just to stay on the beach. (The snorkel area is so close that some of us just swam back to beach.)

We returned to owners' home for fabulous banana bread and rum punch! They also offered free wifi. Then we had another nice ride back to dock.

I can NOT think of 1 negative thing about this excursion. The price is very reasonable considering what you receive. This was our 6th Disney cruise so we've had lots of excursions and this is rated at the top for all of us!

Perfect Cruise Excursion,"This was the best, and least expensive, cruise excursion we have ever taken! (This was our 5th Disney cruise.) I was drawn to this tour because of the excellent reviews on Trip Advisor. We were not disappointed. Mandy was so quick to email back about the tour and correspond with me throughout the process. As promised, Captain Mario was waiting for us on the pier. We visited Stingray Bay, Starfish Point, and made a third stop to snorkel. We took our GoPro, but Captain Mario's photos were much better with his underwater camera. They even give you access to all the photos he takes...for free! There is no other excursion that has does this! And you will definitely want photos of this trip. Feeding and holding the stingrays was an incredible experience. In addition, the crew also brought around water, fruit punch, and pizza during the boat ride. Our children are 10, 13, and 17 and all loved this trip. I do not have one negative comment about this trip.",January 2016,Acquarius Sea Tours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g147367-d2689082-Reviews-Acquarius_Sea_Tours-Seven_Mile_Beach_Grand_Cayman_Cayman_Islands.html,Grand Cayman,attractions,5.0,5.0
