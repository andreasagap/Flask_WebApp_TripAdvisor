Fantastic. Try to go with Enrique as the instructor,"Our instructor was Enrique and made the experience amazingly enjoyable and secure. To be honest, when I walked in I immediately said I would not do the twister but after a trial with him I felt confident enough to do it. What a pleasant thing to do in Barcelona.",May 2021,Windoor Realfly,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g911482-d21087080-Reviews-Windoor_Realfly-Cornella_de_Llobregat_Catalonia.html,"Cornella de Llobregat, Spain",attractions,5.0,5.0

"Great view, sophisticated food","Probably one of the most sophisticated cuisine you will find in and around Catalonia.
A real shame that a restaurant like this does not propose organic local wines on the wine list.
Else I would have given full marks.",May 2021,Restaurant Hotel Aiguablava,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g609015-d996002-Reviews-Restaurant_Hotel_Aiguablava-Begur_Costa_Brava_Province_of_Girona_Catalonia.html,"Begur, Spain",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Almost perfect but some big flows,"We found the view we expected, the location we expected but there are a flew flows with the value you get for the price.
First the bedrooms chairs have metal legs, well designed from an esthetic point of view but not practical: I hurt my toes several times because they were sticking out.
Second, no rubbish bin in the bedroom so we started collecting empty bottles on the desks.
Only a small bin in the bathroom. Very strange.
Then in the bathroom no Q-tips were available, the tissue box was... empty (!) and the shower stopped working at some point. I called the reception and no one could speak either English or French but eventually the water came back.
The sliding door to the toilet was very difficult to open and close, once I thought I would get stuck inside.
The above is a shame and not acceptable for the price one pays.
This said I would like to end with some other positive points than just the view:
From the hotel you can walk down to the rocks and enjoy the quietness, sun and breeze from the sea. The hotel will tell you that they are not responsible if something happens to you though.
We saw a couple of very cute wild cats that someone is feeding, between the hotel and the sea, on the hills. Very nice and kind and I hope it is someone from the hotel. It was nice to see them playing around in the wild.
In room dining and bfast was very good.
The hotel was very clean everywhere.",May 2021,Parador De Aiguablava,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g609015-d288411-Reviews-Parador_De_Aiguablava-Begur_Costa_Brava_Province_of_Girona_Catalonia.html,"Begur, Spain",hotels,4.0,4.0

Could be so much better,"The place is as nice as it is on the pics, if not better. And the food is good too, with for Valentine's day, a few pieces of organic meat. That saved the review from going into ''poor'.
Now, the disappointing parts:
- No decoration on Valentine's day
- No organic wines on the wine list
- Cheap old English music in the background when there are so many good and young local artists.
- We asked for Champagne and we were bought Cava.
- We asked Cognac and we were brought twice Brandy.
- One of the waiters had his mask serving all along under his nose
- The water was brought with slices of lemon whose skins were full of dark dots from being old
- There was a very large rubbish bin in the wide open at the foot of the kitchen stairs. Doesn't look good in a ball room.

Don't look at the location and the outside aspect of the restaurant.. the food is great!,"The first impression isn't very good because it looks like any restaurant but the food is really excellent. The type of place where you have not even finished you are already planning when you will go back.

"Poor service, average food","Untrained staff who looked all surprised/bothered because we wanted a table away from the rest of the guests. Looks like they have never heard of social distancing. Not a smile nothing, no manners.
Then when the time came to move to the next dish the waitress almost dropped the fork and knife on us, just one thing after the other.
Food was average, what you would expect when you go to the restaurant.
Shame because the restaurant has a great deco and projects a higher class feel to it.",September 2020,Cala Blanca,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187497-d3164862-Reviews-Cala_Blanca-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,"Barcelona, Spain",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Some big flaws,"The building has entirely been renovated but based on the outside I expected something more Spanish for the deco, with a soul. Instead you wake up and you could be anywhere if you look around you. Very Ikea looking.
Then the bathroom is modern yes but the shower leaks into the toilets so the esthetic is there but it is already not working.
Finally and perhaps most importantly, some big flaws: I came in and asked if I could be given the details of a private guide. I was answered yes and that I would be called back. I never was and the person at the reception saw me after that in several occasions.
We also were trying to call the reception, with no number we could find to dial in the room. I was dialing 9 and it turns out that it is 7000. How intuitive.
Perhaps the biggest flaw: the hotel has stairs right when you walk in almost. Not welcoming.

A bit disappointed with only one choice of organic red wine.
Birds at the entrance of the restaurant are nice but is it really hygienical?
The rooms are super clean (not crazy about the color of the toilet paper) but very quiet and the breakfast is excellent with local products and an excellent coffee (quality and machine).",July 2020,Le Bel'vue,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g4271089-d4270149-Reviews-Le_Bel_vue-Le_Cergne_Loire_Auvergne_Rhone_Alpes.html,"Le Cergne, France",hotels,4.0,4.5
Too expensive for what it is,"Good location (highway,shopping mall), good toilet paper, bathroom amenities but cheap breakfast buffet, from which you can see a messy kitchen. For that price one would expect fresh orange juice and warm bread.",July 2020,Hotel ibis Styles Saint Julien en Genevois Vitam,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1915745-d1898743-Reviews-Hotel_ibis_Styles_Saint_Julien_en_Genevois_Vitam-Neydens_Haute_Savoie_Auvergne_Rhone_.html,"Neydens, France",hotels,3.0,3.5
Most inefficient tourist attraction,"Good luck if you want to do anything but swim them.
The tourism office gives you a number if you want to rent a pedalo and what you get is an answering machine (in French of course) asking you to book ahead on a bad website and gives you an email address that one can't understand on the recorded message.
No way you can just call and set something up the same day.
The nearby port of Bully or even Cordelle have friendly people picking up the phone who will be very happy to organize something nice for you the same day.",August 2020,Lac des Sapins,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g4604610-d4759768-Reviews-Lac_des_Sapins-Cublize_Rhone_Auvergne_Rhone_Alpes.html,"Cublize, France",attractions,1.0,4.0
"Excellent food, tatooed waiters","Excellent choice and quality of meats, convenient location even if in summer there is no place inside with air cond.
The tatooed waiters give a weird look/vibe to the place which is quite traditional in the end.",July 2020,Urartu al foc,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g652129-d10481817-Reviews-Urartu_al_foc-Castelldefels_Catalonia.html,"Castelldefels, Spain",restaurants,4.0,4.0
"Amazing pools, service and pool food menu","Kudos to the staff at the pool, the cooks for the excellent menu and variety of healthy dishes and the overall service from the hotel, right from the entrance.
Such a delightful experience, and all the privacy one needs.",July 2020,Hotel Arts Barcelona,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187497-d190635-Reviews-Hotel_Arts_Barcelona-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,"Barcelona, Spain",hotels,5.0,4.5
La classe,"Spectacular view of course, good music for the atmosphere and excellent food even if a little on the expensive side.
The service felt a little rush at times but overall we felt that we were having an exclusive moment.
One of the managers who was walking around with an ear piece had his mask below his nose at all times and I even saw him talking to clients mask down, not acceptable but luckily he was not close to us.",July 2020,Mirabe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187497-d997434-Reviews-Mirabe-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,"Barcelona, Spain",restaurants,5.0,4.5
"Really, really good","Fine cuisine, tapas with a twist and High quality ingredients. Small portions, tasty and elegant.
There was only one choice of organic red but a decent one.
Service ok. You get there at 8 and a 10 you are kindly told told pay the bill and leave the table to someone else.
But still a must visit.",July 2020,La Cholita,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187497-d7656551-Reviews-La_Cholita-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,"Barcelona, Spain",restaurants,5.0,4.5
"Excellent products, great presentation and service","Finally a place in the region where ingredients are carefully selected, the presentation very nice and the service excellent in a historical building with a very nice view.
Take away is available.",July 2020,La Cabane,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g13004353-d21085154-Reviews-La_Cabane-Pont_Salomon_Haute_Loire_Auvergne_Rhone_Alpes.html,"Pont-Salomon, France",restaurants,5.0,5.0
"One of the best value for price in the region, great cooking and local products","This place has really gotten better. The meat is now from the region and the wine list includes a few organic wines of very good quality. The snales and the cheeses are out of this world.
The place is opened on Sundays and Mondays, big plus.",June 2020,Chez Subtil,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g19120540-d21050881-Reviews-Chez_Subtil-Saint_Victor_sur_Rhins_Loire_Auvergne_Rhone_Alpes.html,"Saint-Victor-sur-Rhins, France",restaurants,5.0,5.0
Excellent dough but the toppings are common,"The dough is one of the best you will find in that area but it is a shame that the toppings are so common. This said, the service was excellent and the owner is a very friendly guy.",June 2020,La Flambee,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1315154-d10455718-Reviews-La_Flambee-Saint_Didier_en_Velay_Haute_Loire_Auvergne_Rhone_Alpes.html,"Saint-Didier-en-Velay, France",restaurants,4.0,4.5
