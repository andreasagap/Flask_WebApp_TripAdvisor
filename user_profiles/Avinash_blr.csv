Hidden Gem for budget food,"Restaurante Pizza Edwin is a hidden gem, on the main road of Oia. The Pizza selection is good, so is pasta.

"Great Food, Great views, Very good wi-fi","The restaurant is almost invisible, and we came upon it by chance, since it is neither on the main pedestrian pathway, nor is it right next to it.

A good place to have a relaxed lunch,",April 2019,1800-Floga Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g482941-d1538828-Reviews-1800_Floga_Restaurant-Oia_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
A Beauty!!,"The Hotel is perched well with a great view. The manager is really very active and welcoming. By the way, we requested for a paid upgrade to a room with Jacuzzi and they provided it to us since there was availability, at no cost. The rooms are great. The bathroom ventilation was not that good so it was a little smelly. The toiletries are of great quality. Staff is always available to help. The cleaning staff is very proactive. And the Hotel is really, really beautiful.

Since it was spring time, there were tiny bugs all around, not just in the hotel, but across the town. The food seemed a little overpriced in the hotel restaurant. Breakfast was amazing. Once they served orange juice in in-room dining, which either was spoilt orange or was NOT orange. On complaining they replaced it, but I was worried that I may get some stomach bug (did not happen, thankfully). The hotel is so good that you just feel like staying in and not venturing out much.",April 2019,Canaves Oia Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g482941-d228905-Reviews-Canaves_Oia_Hotel-Oia_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",hotels,5.0,5.0
"Very Beautiful Hotel, Conveniently located","The hotel is small, but very pretty. The staff are great. The swimming pool, though small is sufficient (we did not use it though, as in April it was cold and the pool is not heated). The bathroom with the rooms is really nice. The shower is great and the toiletries are good too. Breakfast is basic, but acceptable. The view from the rooms is very nice.

"Great location, great staff","The hotel is located right next to Hadrian's gate, by temple of Zeus. Our room had a nice view of the temple of Zeus. I believe the rooms on the other side possibly will have a view of the acropolis, which is also visible from the restaurant on the top (where breakfast is served). The staff was courteous and helpful. The breakfast was OK, not great, though the view was perfect. Location wise it is one of the best, I must say and very comfortable to even walk around the central district where most of the attractions are.

We stayed in the hotel twice. The second time we stayed only for a night and did face a challenge that the room was getting too hot, we tried to tinker the AC buttons but it did not help. We thought of calling the staff, but then we were too sleepy to wait and had an early morning flight, so we cracked open the window and slept (Opening the window makes it noisy as all the traffic sound from the road comes in). But then the fault was ours that we chose not to call the hotel help. Wi-fi could be stronger. In the first room it was very weak wi-fi.",April 2019,The Athens Gate Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d227384-Reviews-The_Athens_Gate_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.5
Has potential of becoming an exotic heritage resort if....,"8 KMs from Alwar town on a narrow road, followed by last half kilometer of unpaved road, Dadhikar fort sits on Aravallis with a nice view. The place was a dilapidated fort which was reconstructed between 2006-2010 and made into a hotel.

Pros:
1. Exotic feeling
2. Good views
3. Helpful staff
4. Good food (vegetarian only)
5. Rooms are spacious
6. No TV

Cons:
1. Gate gets locked in the night and if you are coming in late you have to inform in advance otherwise a ruckus has to be created to wake up the guard
2. Broken TT table
3. Not much to do in the hotel itself. Actually in the evening if they could do some programs to engage people, that would have been great - some local folk dance, some games etc. Even during the day if they had some thing sorganized that would have been great (like a pottery session, or a bird watching walk etc.).
4. Bathroom - Why they don't put a shower cubicle or even a shower curtain to separate dry and wet sections in these 3 star hotels, I don't understand
5. The room we got had twin beds separated out and bringing it together would have blocked the way
6. No room service
7. No housekeeping in the two days we stayed.
8. In the open air seating at the restaurant, the tables can't be realigned easily as the table top is made of stone. But then the table top is covered with table cloth, so the fact that it is of stone and the beauty of it, is not highlighted.
9. No wifi
10. A small swimming pool would have been a great addition.
11. In the bathroom the towel rack was so far away from the shower area that one has to cross the whole bathroom to get to the towels.
12. Wash basin should have had a counter top, that would have been great.
13. For non-resident guests they charge ticket for entry. I hope they do some guided tour for them, where they can narrate the history of the place and talk about the reconstruction and restoration effort etc.",January 2019,Dadhikar Fort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g679018-d2086966-Reviews-Dadhikar_Fort-Alwar_Alwar_District_Rajasthan.html,"Alwar, India",hotels,3.0,4.0
"Good property, bad food","The property is nice, with decently large rooms. Swimming pool too is nice. The two hammocks are a nice touch. It is right next to a forest.

"Great Beach, Very Poor Sleep Quality","We stayed in lagoon cottage, sharing wall with the next room. The wall offers no sound proofing. We could hear their television all the time while trying to sleep. The beach is excellent, shallow, warm and clean. One can spend the entire vacation on this beach, on the beach chairs, in the water, on the swing or hammock. The pool is also nice, could have been cleaner though. Staff is good everywhere, except for the reception. At reception if you ask for something, you usually have to check again after a few minutes and only then they act on it. We stayed at the resort for new year's eve. The party was really sad with power going out every 10 minutes, the DJ was not worth being called DJ. Food at the party was also nothing to talk about. Another thing is, in the bathrooms there is no concept of dry or wet areas (i.e., shower cubicle or shower curtain. Makes it messy.

Good food... Can get quite busy,"The food potions are good. Dessert is excellent. Drink options are plenty.

Gives you a sense of adventure,The museum has real life replicas of Magellan's ship and Darwin's ship and makes you appreciate the spirit of adventure of the pioneers and the difficult conditions they travelled in.

Business Class - Worth the price - a little chaotic,"The Bangalore to Kuwait flight business class what's not good -

1. No Flat beds. Considering the flight time, where you'd have left your home/hotel at 1:00 AM, it is really a disappointment not to be able to sleep well
2. Very limited entertainment choices
3. No priority boarding for business class (at least not announced)
4. No vanity pouch for amenities like - eye covers and ear plugs for sleeping
5. Blanket given on demand, but very limited in number.
6. Despite baggage being tagged with priority, it does not necessarily follow that

The Goods:
1. Ground staff is quite good
2. Price is great. I got business class which possibly would be as cheap as full fare economy

Note: For those who enjoy their in-flight liquor, its a dry airline",December 2017,Kuwait Airways,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8729107-Reviews-Kuwait-Airways,World,flights,3.0,3.0
"Two stays within a week, two different experiences","We stayed at InterContinental Semiramis twice within a week for two nights each. While the rooms are adequately spacious, the first time we stayed the cleaning was very inadequate. There was hair all around the bathroom and despite asking for the cleanup, it did not get adequately cleaned. Breakfast spread is good at the hotel. Strangely most staff at the reception is consisting of trainees. The swimming pool, which is supposed to be heated, was under renovation/maintenance. In room dining is good. We were in triple room and yet only half liter bottle was provided for free, rest was expected to be paid for. They have Forex machine and ATMs in the hotel, which is good.

Pyramids are Pyramids,The iconic sight. Beware of aggressive hawkers. Take the ticket for entry inside only for the smallest one. It is much cheaper and offers the same experience with less inconvenience. The best pictures come from the back of the smallest Pyramid. Or from near the Sphinx. Light and Sound show is too long.

Sonesta Moon Godess Nile Cruise - Had Expected more,"Rooms: Like most cruises, regular rooms are not that high in space. We did not get the suite since ours was a last minute booking, but I am sure they might have been better.

Food: Very repetitive. Same menu on all 4 days with very minor variations (except one day when there was a BBQ lunch.

Events: On the boat events were OK, though cliched - Belly dancing, Whirling Dervish etc.

Excursions: Too early start. All excursions start before 7:00 AM. Which means for every one to get ready and finish the breakfast requires very early wake up. Not very vacation like. One guide for 40 people is not very engaging. In Luxor, the afternoon excursion should have started earlier instead of giving 3 hours break,two hours should have been sufficient.Because of the late start we missed seeing the highlight, the luxor temple in daylight.

Cruise: There's hardly any cruise. Its mostly a hotel in the water, the reason I say this is because in 4 days of stay the cruise would have moved for only 7-8 hours. Rest of the time it was just anchored.

Also in this day and age for overland river cruise charge of $20 per night for Wi-fi is criminal extortion.",December 2017,Nile River,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294201-d472084-Reviews-Nile_River-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"Cairo, Egypt",attractions,3.0,4.5
