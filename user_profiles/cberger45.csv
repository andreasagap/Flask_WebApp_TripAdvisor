Nice general purpose pub/restaurant in heart of Cambridge.,"Bill's Cambridge is located on charming Green Street in the heart of the University district. Larger than many other pubs, it can accommodate a group if need be. A good selection of drinks and comfort foods. Service was helpful and friendly. A good place to hang out on a rainy day.",October 2019,Bill’s Cambridge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186225-d2192536-Reviews-Bill_s_Cambridge-Cambridge_Cambridgeshire_England.html,"Cambridge, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Nice afternoon tea,"I have been to Harriet's several times, each time with a group of 15-20, which they were able to handle with aplomb. Make reservations if you do plan to go with a group. Harriet's provides a quality afternoon tea experience, with the usual selection of finger sandwiches, scones with clotted cream and jam, and sweet cakes. Located on the charming Green Street in Cambridge, amidst many other shops and establishments, in the heart of the university district. Having tea at Harriet's will enhance any visit to beautiful Cambridge.",June 2019,Harriets Cafe Tearoom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186225-d3216809-Reviews-Harriets_Cafe_Tearoom-Cambridge_Cambridgeshire_England.html,"Cambridge, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,3.5
One of the best coffee shops in Cannon Beach,"This is a great coffee shop for either take-away (no drive through of course), or comfortably settle in on a rainy day. Just a block from the beach. Coffee is good, and the small selection of pastries even better. The berry scones and muffins are tasty with lots of berries baked in. Often pretty busy; I could wish they opened a little earlier than 8am, but that seems par for Cannon Beach establishments. Stop in, you won't be sorry.",October 2019,Insomnia Coffee Co.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g51790-d3488173-Reviews-Insomnia_Coffee_Co-Cannon_Beach_Oregon.html,"Cannon Beach, Oregon",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Nice addition to Cannon Beach,"This new establishment is inside of Morris's Fireside Restaurant, on the right after entering. The log construction and stone fireplace creates a nice ambiance, and there is a good selection of libations. So many places in Cannon Beach are closed by evening hours, so it nice to have a place where you can gather with friends in the evening for dessert and a drink. The music playlist is classic rock (Tom Petty, CCR, etc), and while you can hear it, I liked that the volume is low enough to encourage conversation. This is a cozy place, well worth a visit.",October 2019,MacGregor's of Cannon Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g51790-d19030495-Reviews-MacGregor_s_of_Cannon_Beach-Cannon_Beach_Oregon.html,"Cannon Beach, Oregon",restaurants,5.0,4.5
A Hong Kong experience,"I'm not sure why this is called the ""Ladies Market"" as they have all kinds of goods there, and it seems very similar to the Night market on Temple street. Just walking around and soaking in the street life is fun, if you like that sort of thing, and you can find some bargains especially if you are willing to haggle. Men's and women's scarves can be a particularly good deal, and many are of pretty good quality. A visit here or one of the other street markets is a cultural experience, not to be missed on a visit to Hong Kong. Expect crowds and being jostled around a bit. Secure your personal belongings, as pick pockets are said to roam. Lots of good street food available.",November 2018,Ladies Market,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294217-d635372-Reviews-Ladies_Market-Hong_Kong.html,"Hong Kong, China",attractions,4.0,3.5
Stunning views of Hong Kong,"The Sky 100 observation deck on the 100th floor of the International Commerce Centre is well worth a visit for the incredible views. There is no fee to go up and look around, and there are shops and cafes if you want them. Great views of the harbor and city. This is not even the top floor of the building, but at 100 floors up, you get an unforgettable panorama of Hong Kong.",November 2018,Sky100 Hong Kong Observation Deck,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294217-d2136178-Reviews-Sky100_Hong_Kong_Observation_Deck-Hong_Kong.html,"Hong Kong, China",attractions,5.0,4.5
Walk through history,"The Roman Forum is an incredible experience, walking amongst the buildings and ruins of Roman history. I enjoy historic places and spaces more than museums, and the Forum certainly meets that description. It is free and open to walk through, but it would help to have read some background, and have a map or brochure to understand what you are seeing, or to pay a guide. Take your time and soak it in.",November 2018,Roman Forum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187791-d2154770-Reviews-Roman_Forum-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",attractions,5.0,4.5
Savory or sweet!,"Crepe Neptune in Cannon Beach is just a hole in the wall shop, but the crepes are wonderful. They have a variety of savory crepes, but my favorites are the dessert crepes, which make a great breakfast. I like the one with Nutella, fresh strawberries and bananas, and whipped cream.",October 2019,Crepe Neptune,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g51790-d2177350-Reviews-Crepe_Neptune-Cannon_Beach_Oregon.html,"Cannon Beach, Oregon",restaurants,5.0,4.5
"Quaint setting, great food","After many visits to Cannon Beach I finally made a stop in the Lazy Susan Cafe for brunch. I had the shrimp omelet and sauteed potatoes, and it was very good. The cafe is small but cozy, and you may need to wait for a table. The staff is super friendly and service is great. Note that they only take cash.",October 2019,Lazy Susan Cafe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g51790-d616613-Reviews-Lazy_Susan_Cafe-Cannon_Beach_Oregon.html,"Cannon Beach, Oregon",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Original art in a coastal setting,"The Jeffrey Hull Gallery in Cannon Beach is a delight. Specializing in local coastal settings, the Gallery features a wide range of paintings of various price ranges. The second floor gallery itself is large and provides plenty of space for peaceful reflection. It is well worth a visit anytime one is in Cannon Beach. If Jeffrey is in, he is a gracious host and interpreter of his art.",October 2019,Jeffrey Hull Gallery,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g51790-d13419590-Reviews-Jeffrey_Hull_Gallery-Cannon_Beach_Oregon.html,"Cannon Beach, Oregon",attractions,5.0,5.0
Great beach location,"The town of Cannon Beach is one of the gems of the Oregon coast. The Waves motel is a perfect location from which to enjoy it. Guests enjoy a wonderful view and easy beach access, as well as easy walking distance to much of the town with shops, galleries, restaurants, etc. I have stayed here many times, and always find the staff to be so helpful. The Waves is a great combination of comfort and ""beach casual."" There is a variety of room types and configurations to suit various needs and budgets.",October 2019,The Waves,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g51790-d122250-Reviews-The_Waves-Cannon_Beach_Oregon.html,"Cannon Beach, Oregon",hotels,5.0,4.5
"Nice hotel, great location","I have stayed twice at the London House Hotel in the past several months, once in one of the small single rooms, and once in a double bed room. Rooms are clean and efficiently appointed. The bathrooms were very clean and updated. Staff and management are friendly and helpful. The breakfast is good and worth the price. The lobby area is small and I missed having some sort of on-site lounge or fitness room. The location is great, within walking distance of many shops and restaurants, Hyde Park, as well as two nearby tube stations (Queensway and Bayswater). Overall a very nice experience, one I recommend to others.",September 2019,London House Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d243430-Reviews-London_House_Hotel-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",hotels,4.0,4.0

Very good hotel in Hong Kong,"I stayed at this hotel with a group visiting Hong Kong for a conference. Service was good, and rooms are large and well equipped.

Like a trip back in time,"I have ridden the Star Ferry several times in a couple of trips to Hong Kong. It is the best view and best mode of transport in Hong Kong--affordable and fun.

Great experience,"A colleague had done business with Sandy at Star Tailors, and took several of us who were there visiting Hong Kong for work. We had an appointment, and Sandy created a great experience for us. I ordered a wool and cashmere suit. We took our time choosing fabrics and talking about styles, and Sandy carefully took our measurements. We returned for the fitting several days later, and our completed suits were delivered to our hotel by the end of the week. Mine fits perfectly and gets tons of compliments. I will certainly plan to return and have another made the next time I am in Hong Kong.",November 2018,Star Tailors,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294217-d7142033-Reviews-Star_Tailors-Hong_Kong.html,"Hong Kong, China",attractions,5.0,4.5
Relaxing and scenic,"I take a group of 20 or so American grad students to Cambridge every year, and we have gone punting with ""Let's Go Punting!"" as a fun experience several times. Their online booking for a group has been efficient and problem-free, and the experience itself is a relaxing way to see historic Cambridge from another angle. Boats are safe and stable, and the staff is knowledgeable and fun. There are several punting companies in Cambridge to choose from, but we have been happy with Let's Go Punting! every time we have used them.",June 2019,Chauffeured Punting Tour in Cambridge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g186225-d11474550-Chauffeured_Punting_Tour_in_Cambridge-Cambridge_Cambridgeshire_England.html,"Cambridge, United Kingdom",activities,5.0,5.0
Step into history,"The ""Round Church"" is one of the iconic locations and images of Cambridge. At 900 years old, it is incredibly well preserved and peaceful inside.

The modest fee is well worth it.",June 2019,The Round Church Visitor Centre,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186225-d213772-Reviews-The_Round_Church_Visitor_Centre-Cambridge_Cambridgeshire_England.html,"Cambridge, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,4.0
Good overview of the city,"The City Sightseeing bus tours are a great way to get an overview of the city if time is limited.

Iconic,"A visit to Athens would not be complete without experiencing this most iconic of its locations. After hearing the history, it is amazing that the buildings are as well-preserved as they are.

Outstanding flight,"This was a direct flight from London to Portland, and a great experience for an economy flight. Flight boarded and departed on time, and was staff by an experienced crew. The flight was not full, and I had an empty seat on each side of me, which helped a lot. Amenities included a complimentary wine cocktail, a menu with choice of meals, a warm chocolate chip cookie, and hot towels at the beginning and end of the flight.
