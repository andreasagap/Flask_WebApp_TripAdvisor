The best beaches I have ever been to,"This is a fantastic beach. The sand is so fine it just slips through your fingers and pulls you in. The waves are mild and the water is crystal clear. One can see right through to the sea bed and the fishes swimming around.
The beach is relatively small, may be less than a km in length but the view is just amazing. We reached there when it was raining and in an hour there was clear sunlight and the beach just lights up, the white sand and the blue sea with the rocks at the end and the hills behind is a sight not to miss.

Once you reach the top, the sheer yellow colour of the palace catches your eye and never lets go. The architecture is amazing, there is this huge sculpture of a monster just above the gateway and the entrance is to he right. One can even walk along the walls of the palace and enjoy the mesmerising view of the fog rolling along the tree tops.

The interior of the palace is a little less amazing than the front but beautiful nonetheless. This is the summer palace of the king of Portugal and once can see it in every hall and room.

It was 2nd of Jan and as expected, there were a lot of people going to the temple. After a short walk up the hill, through the market, we left our shoes and mobiles at the clock room and proceeded up the steps.

The thing I like the most is the fact that it is completely made of white marble and the lighting is so good that you can see the temple from miles around. Amidst the shouts of 'Govinda' we entered the premises and paid our homage to Lord vishnu and then settled down on the open spaces to enjoy the view of the Hussain Sagar lake and necklace road along with the cool breeze.

We landed up at the nearest metro station and walked up to the wall surrounding Vatican. My first glimpse was the blue dome and I was struck by how magnificent and towering it was.
But I was wrong. When you enter St Peter's Square you start to feel so small in front of this towering monument. The square was huge and there was this huge queue and the sun blazing down on us. We waited for almost 3 hours in the queue and finally got admitted to the Basilica.
Then we took the 500+ steps to the top and clicked some awesome pics of Rome and the square. That sight from the top of the Basilica is just priceless, no one should miss it. From up there you also get a birds eye view of the inside. from up there people inside look like ants.

Then we finally entered St. Peters and were just blown. The sheer size of the place is staggering, you have these beautiful flawless statues and sculptures across all the walls and pillars, its just amazing.

The Dolphin show was the best as you see those beautiful animals jump out of the water and their trainers taking them around and even riding them.

The Elephant show was quite hilarious as you see them lining up and parading up and down the stage. They throw darts. quite accurately, I might say and also have acts involving the audience.

The entrance is from the side and there are racks where they offer you clothes to cover your head and body before entering the mosque. The mosque is extremely well preserved, the walls the decorated ceilings all are just mesmerising. You will be just captivated!

Beautiful place and a must go if you end up in Kuala Lumpur,"This place is big, divided into 5 theme parks: Water park, Extreme Sports, Amusement park, Scary House and Wildlife park.
The thing I liked the best was the hanging bridge over the park, one of the longest in the world and the view from up there is just awesome. The rides in the amusement park are good but the best part are the adventure sports. One can bungee jump, go kart of fly on a line over the park.

One of the best gardens I have been to,"Now this is a proper greenhouse. The gardens are divided into two parts - one for flowers and the other has the cloud walk.

We went to the flower garden first. I was just overwhelmed with the variety of flowers and plant they have here. Plus it is just exquisitely beautiful. You also get a good view of the Marina Bay Sands hotel, an added view to look forward to.

The cloud walk is just breathtaking. Just in front of the entrance is the highest man-made waterfall. Then we took the elevator to the top and started walking down. The cloud walk is aptly named as there is a cloud-like atmosphere all around and as expected, the view is awesome. You are just transported to a different place.

One of the most beautiful and well preserved places in Scandinavia.,"Suomenlinna Island was suggested to us by a few friends we met in Stockholm. We immediately decided to take the take the overnight cruise and landed at the port in the morning. A short ferry ride and we were at Suomenlinna.

It was a nice small island a few houses here and there but the scenery was breathtaking. The chapel, the fort the small river running down the middle of the island.

In the docks just at the other end of the were docked some 50 boats and the view of the city walls from that side is just mesmerising. This is a must visit for all tourists out there. No doubt it is an UNESCO world heritage site!

A museum to envy,"Note: We went to the Louvre in October 2013.

The Louvre needs no introduction. The home of the Mona Lisa and pieces of history that had shaped the world more than once.

The first thing that I noticed as soon as I came out of the metro station was the magnificence of this great structure. The entrance itself is mesmerising and the moment I enters the foyer with the glass pyramid standing proud in the centre, I felt why this is one of the greatest museums in the world.

We stood in queue for some 30 minutes and entered the main waiting and ticketing area; it was huge. There are three part and likewise three entrances to the museum. We spent some 5-6 hours in the museum and covered as many parts as we could. My most favourite part of the museum was the part that housed the belongings of Emperor Napoleon. The huge dining table and the huge chandeliers, they made you feel small!

And of course the Mona Lisa! After a little struggle I was able to take a clear picture of this masterpiece. The place was thronged with patrons from all over the world and it really took some effort to reach to the front.

Apart from these we also visited the paintings, the sculptures and the Egyptian section. A great place to spend a day.

Some 5 minutes walk from the first gate and you can find throngs of tourists in queue to get their tickets to the Palace premises. There are two types of tickets - One is only entrance to the Palace and the other is Palace and the Harem (The Royal Family's quarters).

The Palace has many buildings, with different sights to offer. The first building houses the treasures of the Eastern Roman Empire. There resides the famous and magnificent Topkapi Diamond. Many more jewels, ornate daggers and swords adorn the walls, well preserved in their glass chambers. There are some rooms show casing the sitting areas, open spaces giving an amazing view of the ocean and the city.
After a long walk across many stairs and small rooms, we ended in what I would say is the best collection I have ever seen - The belongings of the Prophets! The sword of Prophet David, the clothes of Prophet Mohammed and the Staff of Prophet Moses; among many possessions of unbelievable significance to the world.
The Harem actually pales to the significance of these collections but nonetheless are so well decorated and maintained that it just grips you in awe. The intricate work adorning the walls the views and most importantly the ceilings, just breathtaking!
